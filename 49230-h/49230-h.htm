<h2 class="p4"><a name="c5" id="c5">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Millbank Prison</span> stood for nearly a century
upon the banks of the Thames between Westminster
and Vauxhall, a well-known gloomy pile by the
river side, with its dull exterior, black portals, and
curious towers. This once famous prison no longer
attracts the wide attention of former days but the
very name contains in itself almost an epitome of
British penal legislation. With it one intimately
associates such men as John Howard and Jeremy
Bentham; an architect of eminence superintended
its erection; while statesmen and high dignitaries,
dukes, bishops, and members of Parliament were to
be found upon its committee of management, exercising
a control that was far from nominal or perfunctory,
not disdaining a close consideration of the
minutest details, and coming into intimate personal
communion with the criminal inmates, whom, by
praise or admonition, they sought to reward or reprove.
Its origin and the causes that brought it
into being; its object, and the success or failure of
those who ruled it; its annals, and the curious incidents
with which they are filled,&mdash;these are
topics of much interest to the general reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>At this distant time it is indeed interesting to
observe how thoroughly John Howard understood
the subject to which he had devoted his life. In his
prepared plan for the erection of the prison he anticipates
exactly the method we are pursuing to-day,
after more than a century of experience. “The
Penitentiary Houses,” he says, “I would have built
in a great measure by the convicts. I will suppose
that a power is obtained from Parliament to employ
such of them as are now at work on the Thames,
or some of those who are in the county gaols, under
sentence of transportation, as may be thought most
expedient. In the first place, let the surrounding
wall, intended for full security against escapes, be
completed, and proper lodges for the gatekeepers.
Let temporary buildings of the nature of barracks
be erected in some part of this enclosure which will
be wanted the least, till the whole is finished. Let
one or two hundred men, with their proper keepers,
and under the direction of the builder, be employed
in levelling the ground, digging out the foundation,
serving the masons, sawing the timber and stone;
and as I have found several convicts who were carpenters,
masons, and smiths, these may be employed
in their own branches of trade, since such work is
as necessary and proper as any other in which they
can be engaged. Let the people thus employed
chiefly consist of those whose term is nearly expired,
or who are committed for a short term; and
as the ground is suitably prepared for the builders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the garden made, the wells dug, and the building
finished, let those who are to be dismissed go off
gradually, as it would be very improper to send
them back to the hulks or gaols again.”</p>

<p>Suggestions such as these may have seemed impossible
to those to whom they were propounded;
but that the plan of action was simple and feasible,
is now most satisfactorily proved. Elam Lynds,
the celebrated governor of Sing-Sing prison, in the
State of New York, acted precisely in this manner,
encamping out in the open with his hundreds of
prisoners, and compelling them in this way to build
their own prison-house, cell by cell, as bees would
build a hive. De Tocqueville, commenting on this
seemingly strange episode of prison history, observes
that “the manner in which Mr. Elam Lynds
built Sing-Sing would no doubt raise incredulity,
were not the fact quite recent, and publicly known
in the United States. To understand it we have
only to realize what resources the new prison discipline
of America placed at the disposal of an energetic
man.”</p>

<p>Plans for the new penitentiary buildings were
actually prepared, and operations about to commence,
when the Government suddenly decided to
suspend further proceedings. The principle of
transportation had never been entirely abandoned.
Western Africa had indeed been selected for a penal
settlement, and a few convicts sent there in spite
of the deadly character of the climate. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
statesmen of the day had fully recognized that they
had no right to increase the punishment of imprisonment
by making it also capital; and the Government,
despairing of finding a suitable place of exile,
was about to commit itself entirely to the plan of
home penitentiaries, when the discoveries of Captain
Cook in the South Seas drew attention to the
vast territories of Australasia. Embarking hotly
on the new project, the Government could not well
afford to continue steadfast to the principle of penitentiaries,
and the latter might have fallen to the
ground altogether, but for the interposition of Jeremy
Bentham. This remarkable man published, in
1791, his “Panopticon, or the Inspection House,”
a valuable work on prison discipline, and followed
it, in 1792, by a formal proposal to erect a prison on
the plan he advocated.</p>

<p>The outlines on which this model prison was to
be constructed were also indicated in a memorandum
by Mr. Bentham: “A circular building, an
iron cage, glazed, a glass lantern as large as Ranelagh,
with the cells on the outer circumference,”&mdash;such
was his main idea. Within, in the very centre,
an inspection station was so fixed that every cell
and every part of a cell could be at all times closely
observed; but, by means of blinds and other contrivances,
the inspectors were concealed, unless they
saw fit to show themselves, from the view of the
prisoners; by which the feeling of a sort of invisible
omnipresence was to pervade the whole place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
There was to be solitude or limited seclusion <i>ad
libitum</i>; but, unless for punishment, limited seclusion
in assorted companies was to be preferred. As
we have seen, Bentham proposed to throw the place
open as a kind of public lounge, and to protect the
prisoners from ill-treatment they were to be enabled
to hold conversations with the visitors by means of
tubes reaching from each cell to the general centre.</p>

<p>Bentham’s project had much to recommend it
and it was warmly embraced by Mr. Pitt and Lord
Dundas, the Home Secretary. But secret influences
were hostile to it. It is believed that King George
III opposed it from personal dislike of Bentham
who was an advanced radical. Year after year, although
taken up by Parliament, the measure hung
fire. At last in 1810 active steps were taken to re-open
the question, thanks to the vigour with which
Sir Samuel Romilly called public attention to the
want of penitentiaries. Nothing now would please
the House of Commons but immediate action; and
this eagerness to begin is in strange contrast with
the previous long years of delay.</p>

<p>Negotiations were not re-opened with Bentham,
except in so far as he was entitled to remuneration
for his trouble and original outlay. Eventually his
claims were referred, by Act of Parliament, to arbitration,
and so settled. The same Act empowered
certain supervisors to be appointed, hereafter to
become possessed of the lands in Tothill Fields,
which Bentham had originally bought on behalf of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the Government. These lands were duly transferred
to Lord Farnborough, George Holford,
Esq., M. P., and the Rev. Mr. Becher, and under
their supervision the Millbank Penitentiary as it
now stands was commenced and finished.</p>

<h3>THE BUILDING OF THE PENITENTIARY</h3>

<p class="pch">Choice of Site&mdash;Ancient Millbank&mdash;Plan of new Building&mdash;Penitentiary
described&mdash;Committee appointed to Superintend&mdash;Opening
of Prison in 1816&mdash;First Governor and

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lands which Jeremy Bentham bought from
Lord Salisbury were a portion of the wide area
known then as Tothill Fields; speaking more exactly,
they lay on either side of the present Vauxhall-bridge
Road. This road, constructed after the
purchase, intersected the property, dividing it into
two lots of thirty-eight and fifteen acres respectively.
It was on a slice of the larger piece that the
prison was ultimately built, on ground lying close
by the river. This neighbourhood, now known as
a part of Pimlico, was then a low marshy locality,
with a soil that was treacherous and insecure, especially
at the end towards Millbank Row. People
were alive twenty years ago who had shot snipe in
the bogs and quagmires round about this spot. A
large distillery, owned by a Mr. Hodge, stood near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the proposed site of the prison; but otherwise these
parts were but sparsely covered with houses.
Bentham, speaking of the site he purchased, declared
that it might be considered “in no neighbourhood
at all.” No house of any account, superior
to a tradesman’s or a public-house, stood within
a quarter of a mile of the intended prison, and there
were in this locality one other prison and any number
of almshouses, established at various dates. Of
these the most important were Hill’s, Butler’s,
Wicher’s, and Palmer’s&mdash;all left by charitable
souls of these names; and Stow says, that Lady
Dacre also, wife of Gregory Lord Dacre of the
South, left £100 a year to support almshouses which
were built in these fields “more towards Cabbage
Lane.” Here, also, stands the Green Coats Hospital,
erected by Charles I, but endowed by Charles
II for twenty-five boys and six girls, with a schoolmaster
to teach them. Adjoining this hospital is
a bridewell described by Stow as “a place for the
correction of such loose and idle livers as are taken
up within the liberty of Westminster, and thither
sent by the Justices of the Peace, for correction&mdash;which
is whipping, and beating of Hemp (a punishment
very well suited for idlers), and are thence
discharged by order of the Justices as they in their
wisdom find occasion.” Again, Stow remarks: “In
Tothill Fields, which is a large spacious place, there
are certain pest-houses; now made use of by twelve
poor men and their wives, so long as it shall please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
God to keep us from the Plague. These Pest-houses
are built near the Meads, and remote from
people.” Hospitals, bridewells, alms and pest-houses&mdash;the
chief occupants of these lonely fields,
formed no unfitting society for the new neighbour
that was soon to be established amongst them.</p>

<p>As the prison, when completed, took its name
from the mill bank, that margined the Thames close
at hand, I must pause to refer to this embankment.
I can find no record giving the date of the construction
of this bank, which was no doubt intended
to check the overflow of the river, and possibly,
also, to act as one side of the mill-race, which served
the Abbot of Westminster’s mill. This mill, which
is in fact the real sponsor of the locality, is marked
on the plan of Westminster from Norden’s survey,
taken in Queen Elizabeth’s reign, in 1573. It
stands on the bank of the Thames, almost opposite
the present corner of Abingdon and Great College
Streets; but it is not quite clear whether it was
turned by water from the river, brought along Millbank,
or by the stream that came from Tothill
Street, which, taking the corner of the present
Rochester Row, flowed along the line of the present
Great College Street, and under Millbridge to the
Queen’s slaughter-house. “The Millbank,” says
Stow, “is a very long place, which beginneth by
Lindsey House, or rather by the Palace Yard, and
runneth up to Peterborough House, which is the
farthest house. The part from against College<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Street unto the Horse Ferry hath a good row of
buildings on the east side, next to the Thames,
which is mostly taken up with large wood-mongers’
yards, and Brew-houses; and here is a water house
which serveth this side of the town; the North
Side is but ordinary, except one or two houses by
the end of College Street; and that part beyond the
Horse Ferry hath a very good row of houses, much
inhabited by the gentry, by reason of the pleasant
situation and prospect of the Thames. The Earl of
Peterborough’s house hath a large courtyard before
it and a fine garden behind it, but its situation
is but bleak in the winter, and not over healthful,
as being so near the low meadows on the South and
West Parts.” But it was on one edge of these low,
well-wooded meadows that Millbank Penitentiary
was to be built.</p>

<p>The first act was to decide upon the plan for the
new prison buildings. It was thrown open to competition
by public advertisement and a reward was
offered for the three best tenders. Mr. Hardwicke
was eventually appointed architect and he estimated
that £259,725 would be required for the work with
a further sum of £42,690 for the foundations. Accommodation
was to be provided at this price for
six hundred prisoners, male and female, in equal
proportions; and the whole building was intended
solely for the confinement of offenders in the counties
of London and Middlesex. By subsequent decisions,
arrived at after the work was first undertaken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the size of Millbank grew to greater proportions,
till it was ultimately made capable of containing,
as one great national penitentiary, all the transportable
convicts who were not sent abroad or confined
in the hulks. Of course its cost increased
<i>pari passu</i> with its size. By the time the prison was
finally completed, the total expenditure had risen as
high as £458,000. And over and above this enormous
sum, the outlay of many additional thousands
was needed within a few years, for the repairs or
restoration of unsatisfactory work.</p>

<p>The Penitentiary, as it was commonly called,
looked on London maps like a six-pointed star-fort,
as if built against catapults and old-fashioned engines
of war. The central point was the chapel, a
circular building which, with the space around it,
covered rather more than half an acre of ground.
A narrow building, three stories high, and forming a
hexagon, surrounded the chapel, with which it was
connected at three points by covered passages.
This chapel and its annular belt, the hexagon,
form the keystone of the whole system. It was the
centre of the circle, from which the several bastions
of the star-fort radiated. Each of these salients
was in shape a pentagon, and there were six of
them, one opposite each side of the hexagon. They
were built three stories high, on four sides of the
pentagon, having a small tower at each external
angle; while on the fifth side a wall about nine feet
high ran parallel to the adjacent hexagon. In these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
pentagons were the prisoners’ cells, while the inner
space in each, in area about two-thirds of an acre,
contained the airing yards, grouped round a tall,
central watch-tower. The ends of the pentagons
joined the hexagon at certain points called junctions.
The whole space covered by these buildings
has been estimated at about seven acres; and something
more than that amount was included between
them and the boundary wall, which took the shape
of an octagon, and beyond it was a moat.</p>

<p>Such is a general outline of the plan of the prison.
Any more elaborate description might prove as confusing
as was the labyrinth within to those who
entered without such clues to guide them as were
afforded by familiarity and long practice. There
was one old warder who served for years at Millbank,
and rose through all the grades to a position
of trust, who was yet unable, to the last, to find
his way about the premises. He carried with him
always a piece of chalk, with which he blazed his
path, as does the backwoodsman the forest trees.
Angles at every twenty yards, winding staircases,
dark passages, innumerable doors and gates,&mdash;all
these bewildered the stranger, and contrasted
strongly with the extreme simplicity of modern
prison architecture. Indeed Millbank, with its intricacy
and massiveness of structure, was suggestive
of an order that has passed. It was one of
the last specimens of an age to which Newgate belonged;
a period when the safe custody of criminals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
could be compassed, people thought, only by granite
blocks and ponderous bolts and bars. Such notions
were really a legacy of mediævalism, bequeathed by
the ruthless chieftains, who imprisoned offenders
within their own castle walls. Many such keeps
and castles long existed as prisons; having in the
lapse of time ceased to be great residences, and they
served until recently cleared as gaols or houses of
correction for their immediate neighbourhood.</p>

<p>On the 9th February, 1816, the supervisors reported
that the Penitentiary was now partly ready
for the reception of offenders, and begged that a
committee might be appointed to take charge of the
prison, under the provisions of an act by which
the king in Council was thus empowered to appoint
“any fit and discreet persons, not being less
than ten or more than twenty, as and for a Committee
to Superintend the Penitentiary House for
the term of one year, then next ensuing, and until
a fresh nomination or appointment shall take
place.” Accordingly, at the court at Brighton, on
the 21st of February of the same year, his Royal
Highness the prince regent in Council nominated
the Right Hon. Charles Abbot, Speaker of the
House of Commons, and nineteen others to serve
on this committee, and it met for the first time at
the prison on the 12th of March following. The
Right Hon. Charles Long, George Holford, Esq.,
and the Rev. J. J. Becher, were among the members
of the new committee, but they continued their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
functions as supervisors distinct from the other
body, until the final completion of the whole building
in 1821.</p>

<p>The first instalment of prisoners did not arrive
till the 27th of July following. In the interval,
however, there was plenty of work to be done.
The preparation of rules and regulations, the appointment
of a governor, chaplain, matron, and
other officials, were among the first of them; and
the committee took up each subject with characteristic
vigour. It was necessary also to decide upon
some scale of salaries and emoluments; to arrange
with the Treasury as to the receipts, custody, and
payments of the public moneys; and to ascertain
the sorts of manufactures best suited to the establishment,
and the best method of obtaining work
for the convicts, without having to purchase the
materials.</p>

<p>On the 10th of March Mr. John Shearman was
appointed governor. This gentleman was strongly
recommended by Lord Sidmouth, who stated in a
letter to the Speaker that, having been induced to
make particular inquiries respecting his qualifications
and his character, he had found them well
adapted to the office in question. Mr. Shearman’s
own account of himself was, that he was a native
of Yorkshire, but chiefly resident in London; that
he was aged forty-four, was married, had eight
children, and that he had been brought up to the
profession of a solicitor, but for the last four years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
had been second clerk in the Hatton Garden police
office. Before actually entering upon his duties, the
committee sent Mr. Shearman on a tour of inspection
through the provinces, to visit various gaols,
and report on their condition and management.</p>

<p>He eventually resigned his appointment, however,
because he thought the pay insufficient, and
because the committee found fault with his frequent
absences from the prison. He seems to have endeavoured
to carry on a portion of his old business
as solicitor concurrently with his governorship.
His journals show him to have been an anxious
and a painstaking man, but neither by constitution
nor training was he exactly fitted for the position
he was called upon to fill as head of the Penitentiary.</p>

<p>At the same time, on the recommendation of the
Bishop of London, the Rev. Samuel Bennett was
appointed chaplain. Touching this appointment the
bishop wrote, “I have found a clergyman of very
high character for great activity and beneficence,
and said to be untainted with fanaticism.... His
answer is not yet arrived; but I think he will not
refuse, as he finds the income of his curacy inadequate
to the maintenance of a family, and is precluded
from residence on a small property by want
of a house and the unhealthiness of the situation.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pratt was made house-surgeon, and a Mr.
Webbe, son of a medical man, and bred himself to
that profession, was appointed master manufacturer;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
being of a mechanical turn of mind, he had
made several articles of workmanship, and he produced
to the committee specimens of his shoe-making,
and paper screens.</p>

<p>There was more difficulty in finding a matron.
“The committee,” writes Mr. Morton Pitt, “was
fully impressed with the importance of the charge,
and with the difficulty of finding a fit person to fill
this most essential office.” Many persons were of
opinion that it would be impracticable to procure
any person of credit or character to undertake the
duties of a situation so arduous and so unpleasant,
and the fact that no one had applied for it was
strong proof of the prevalence of such opinions.
Mr. Pitt goes on: “The situation is a new one.
I never knew but two instances of a matron in a
prison, and those were the wives of turnkeys or
porters. In the present case it is necessary that a
person should be selected of respectability as to
situation in life. How difficult must it be to find
a female educated as and having the feelings of
a gentlewoman, who would undertake a duty so
revolting to every feeling she has hitherto possessed,
and even so alarming to a person of that
sex.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt, however, had his eye on a person who
appeared to him in every way suitable. He writes:
“Mrs. Chambers appears to me to possess the requisites
we want; and I can speak of her from a continued
knowledge of her for almost thirty years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
since she was about fifteen. Her father was in the
law, and clerk of the peace for the county of Dorset
from 1750 to 1790. He died insolvent, and
she was compelled to support herself by her own
industry, for her husband behaved very ill to her,
abandoned her, and then died. She has learned
how to obey, and since that, having kept a numerous
school, how to command. She is a woman
forty-three years of age, of a strong sense of religion
and the most strict integrity. She has much
firmness of character with a compassionate heart,
and I am firmly persuaded will most conscientiously
perform every duty she undertakes to the utmost
of her power and ability.” Accordingly Mrs.
Chambers was duly appointed.</p>

<p>The same care was exhibited in all the selections
for the minor posts of steward, turnkeys male and
female, messengers, nurses, porters, and patrols;
and most precise rules and regulations were drawn
up for the government of everybody and everything
connected with the establishment. All these
had, in the first instance, to be submitted for the
approval of the Judges of the Court of King’s
Bench, and subsequently reported to the king in
Council and both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>The supreme authority in the Penitentiary was
vested in the superintending committee, who were
required to make all contracts, examine accounts,
pay bills, and make regular inspection of prison and
prisoners. A special meeting of the committee was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to be convened in the second week of each session
of Parliament, in order to prepare the annual report.
Under them the governor attended to the
details of administration. He was to have the same
powers as are incident to a sheriff or gaoler,&mdash;to
see every prisoner on his or her admittance;
to handcuff or otherwise punish the turbulent; to
attend chapel; and finally, to have no employment
other than such as belonged to the duties of his
office. The chaplain was to be in priest’s orders,
and approved by the bishop of the diocese, and to
have no other profession, avocation, or duty whatsoever.
Besides his regular Sunday and week-day
services, he was to endeavour by all means in his
power to obtain an intimate knowledge of the particular
disposition and character of every prisoner,
male and female; direct them to be assembled for
the purposes of religious instruction in such manner
as might be most conducive to their reformation.
He was expected also to allot a considerable
portion of his time, after the hours of labour, to
visiting, admonishing and instructing the prisoners,
and to keep a “Character-Book,” containing a
“full and distinct account from time to time of all
particulars relating to the character, disposition,
and progressive improvement of every prisoner.”
Intolerance was not encouraged, for even then the
visitation of ministers other than those of the Established
Church was permitted on special application
by the prisoners. Such ministers were only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
required to give in their names and descriptions,
and were admitted at such hours and in such manner
as the governor deemed reasonable, confining
their ministrations to the persons requiring their
attendance. No remuneration was, however, to be
granted to these additional clergymen. The duties
prescribed for the house-surgeon were of the ordinary
character, but in cases of difficulty he was to
confer with the consulting physician and other non-resident
medical men. The master manufacturer
was to act as the governor’s deputy if called upon,
and was charged more especially with the control
and manufacture of all materials and stores. It was
his duty to make the necessary appraisement of the
value of work done, and to enter the weekly percentage.
The total profit was thus divided: three-fourths
to the establishment, or 15<i>s.</i> in the pound;
one twenty-fourth to the master manufacturer, the
taskmaster of the pentagon, and the turnkey of the
ward; leaving the balance of one-eighth, or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
in the pound to be credited to the prisoner.</p>

<p>For the rest of the officers the rules were what
might be expected. The steward took charge of
the victualling, clothing, etc., and superintended the
cooking, baking, and all branches of the domestic
economy of the establishment; the taskmasters
overlooked the turnkeys, and were responsible for
all matters connected with the labour and earnings
of the prisoners; and the turnkeys, male and female,
each having charge of a certain number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
prisoners, were to observe their conduct, extraordinary
diligence, or good behaviour. The turnkey
was expected to enforce his orders with firmness,
but was expected to act with the utmost humanity
to all prisoners under his care. On the other hand,
he was not to be familiar with any of the prisoners,
or converse with them unnecessarily, but was to
treat them as persons under his authority and control,
and not as his companions or associates. The
prisoners themselves were to be treated in accordance
with the aims and principles of the establishment.
On first arrival they were carefully examined
by the doctor, cleansed, deprived of all money,
and their old clothes burned or sold. Next, entering
the first or probation class, they remained
therein during half of the period of their imprisonment.
Their time in prison was thus parcelled
out: at the hour of daybreak, according to the time
of the year, they rose; cell doors opened, they were
taken to wash, for which purpose soap and round
towels were provided; after that to the working
cells until 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, then their breakfast&mdash;one pint
of hot gruel; at half-past nine to work again till
half-past twelve; then dinner&mdash;for four days of
the week six ounces of coarse beef, the other three
a quantity of thick soup, and always daily a pound
of bread made of the whole meal. For dinner and
exercise an hour was allowed, after which they
again set to work, stopping in summer at six, and
in winter at sunset. They were then again locked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
up in their cells, having first, when the evenings were
light, an hour’s exercise, and last of all supper&mdash;another
pint of gruel, hot.</p>

<p>The turnkeys were to be assisted by wardsmen
and wardswomen, selected from the more decent
and orderly prisoners. These attended chiefly to
the cleanliness of the prison, and were granted a
special pecuniary allowance. “Second class” prisoners
were appointed also, to act as trade instructors.
Any prisoner might work extra hours
on obtaining special permission. The general demeanour
of the whole body of inmates was regulated
by the following rule: “No prisoner shall disobey
the orders of the governor or any other officer,
or shall treat any of the officers or servants
of the prison with disrespect; or shall be idle or
negligent in his work, or shall wilfully mismanage
the same; or absent himself without leave from
divine service, or behave irreverently thereat; or
shall be guilty of cursing or swearing, or of any indecent
expression or conduct, or of any assault,
quarrel, or abusive words; or shall game with, defraud,
or claim garnish, or any other gratuity from
a fellow-prisoner; or shall cause any disturbance
or annoyance by making a loud noise, or otherwise;
or shall endeavour to converse or hold intercourse
with prisoners of another division; or shall disfigure
the walls by writing on them, or otherwise;
or shall deface, secrete, or destroy, or pull down the
printed abstracts of rules; or shall wilfully injure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
any bedding or other article provided for the use of
prisoners.” Offences such as the foregoing were to
be met by punishment, at the discretion of the governor,
either by being confined in a dark cell, or by
being fed on bread and water only, or by both such
punishments; more serious crimes being referred
to the committee, who had power to inflict one
month’s bread and water diet and in a dark cell.
Any extraordinary diligence or merit, on the other
hand, was to be brought to the notice of the Secretary
of State, in order that the prisoner might be
recommended as an object for the royal mercy.
When finally discharged, the prisoners were to receive
decent clothing, and a sum of money at the
discretion of the committee, in addition to their
accumulated percentage, or tools, provided such
money or such tools did not exceed a value of three
pounds. Moreover, if any discharged prisoner, at
the end of twelve months, could prove on the testimony
of a substantial housekeeper, or other respectable
person, that he was earning an honest livelihood
he was to be entitled to a further gratuity not exceeding
three pounds.</p>

<p>The early discipline of the prisoners in Millbank,
as designed by the committee, was based on the
principle of constant inspection and regular employment.
Solitary imprisonment was not insisted
upon, close confinement in a punishment cell being
reserved for misconduct. All prisoners on arrival
were located at the lodge, and kept apart, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
work, for the first five days; the object in view being,
to awaken them to reflection, and a true sense
of their situation. During this time the governor
visited each prisoner in the cell for the purpose of
becoming acquainted with his character, and explaining
to him the spirit in which the establishment
had been erected. No pains were spared in this respect.
The governor’s character-books, which I
have examined, are full of the most minute, I might
add trivial, details. After the usual preliminaries
of bathing, hair-cutting, and so forth, the prisoners
passed on to one of the pentagons and entered the
first class.</p>

<p>The only difference between first and second
class was, that the former worked alone, each in his
own cell; the latter in company, in the work rooms.
The question of finding suitable employment soon
engaged the attention of the committee. At first
the males tried tailoring, the females needlework.
Great efforts were made to introduce various trades.
Many species of industry were attempted, skilled
prisoners teaching the unskilled. Thus, at first, one
man who could make glass beads worked at his own
trade, and had a class under him; another, a tinman,
turned out tin-ware, in which he was assisted
by his brother, a “free man” and a more experienced
workman; and several cells were filled with
prisoners who manufactured rugs under the guidance
of a skilful prison artisan. But Mr. Holford,
one of the committee, in a paper laid before his colleagues,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in 1822, was forced to confess that all these
undertakings had failed. The glass-bead blower
misconducted himself; the free tinman abused the
confidence of the committee, probably by trafficking,
and the rug-maker was soon pardoned and set
at large. By 1822 almost all manufactures, including
flax breaking, had been abandoned, and the
prisoners’ operations were confined to shoe-making,
tailoring, and weaving. Mr. Holford, in the same
pamphlet, objects to the first of these trades, complaining
that shoemakers’ knives were weapons too
dangerous to be trusted in the hands of prisoners.
Tailoring was hard to accomplish, from the scarcity
of good cutters, and weaving alone remained as
a suitable prison employment. In fact, thus early
in the century, the committee were brought face
to face with a difficulty that even now, after years
of experience, is pressing still for solution.</p>

<h3>EARLY MANAGEMENT</h3>

<p class="pch">System proposed and Discipline to be enforced&mdash;Conduct of
Prisoners; riotous in Chapel&mdash;Outbreak of Females&mdash;Revolt
against Dietary&mdash;Millbank overgoverned&mdash;Constant
interference of Committee&mdash;Life inside irregular and
irksome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> system to be pursued at the Penitentiary
has now been described at some length. Beyond
doubt&mdash;and of this there is abundant proof in the
prison records&mdash;the committee sought strenuously
to give effect to the principles on which the establishment
was founded. Nevertheless their proceedings
were more or less tentative, for as yet little
was known of so-called “systems” of prison discipline,
and those who had taken Millbank under
their charge were compelled to feel their way
slowly and with caution, as men still in the dark.
The Penitentiary was essentially an experiment&mdash;a
sort of crucible into which the criminal elements
were thrown, in the hope that they might be
changed or resolved by treatment into other superior
forms. The members of the committee were
always in earnest, and they spared themselves no
pains. If they had a fault, it was in over-tenderness
towards the felons committed to their charge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Millbank was a huge plaything; a toy for a parcel
of philanthropic gentlemen, to keep them busy during
their spare hours. It was easy to see that they
loved to run in and out of the place, and to show it
off to their friends; thus we find the visitor, Sir
Archibald Macdonald, bringing a party of ladies
to visit the pentagon, when “the prisoners read and
went through their religious exercises,” which edifying
spectacle gave great satisfaction to the persons
present. Again, at Christmas time the prisoners
were regaled with roast beef and plum pudding,
after which they returned thanks to the Rev.
Archdeacon Potts, the visitor (who was present,
with a select circle of ladies and gentlemen), “appearing
very grateful, and singing ‘God save the
King.’” With such sentiments uppermost in the
minds of the superintending committee, it is not
strange that the gaoler and other officials should
be equally kind and considerate. No punishment
of a serious nature was ever inflicted without a
report to the visitor, or his presence on the spot.
All of the female prisoners, when they were first
received, were found to be liable to fits, and the
tendency gave Mr. Shearman great concern, till it
was found that by threatening to shave and blister
the heads of all persons so afflicted immediate cure
followed. Two Jewesses, having religious scruples,
refused to eat the meat supplied, whereupon the
husband of one of them was permitted to bring in
for their use “coarse meat and fish, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the custom of the Jews;” and later we find the same
man came regularly to read the Jewish prayers, as
he stated, “out of the Hebrew book.” Many of
the women refused positively to have their hair
cut short; and for a time were humoured. In February,
1817, all the female prisoners were assembled,
and went through a public examination, before
the Bishops of London and Salisbury, to show
their progress in religious instruction, and acquitted
themselves greatly to the satisfaction of all present.</p>

<p>Judith Lacy, having been accused of stealing tea
from a matron’s canister, which had been put down,
imprudently, too near the prisoner, was so hurt at
the charge, that it threw her into fits. She soon recovered,
and it was quite evident she had stolen
the tea. Any complaint of the food was listened to
with immediate attention. Thus the gruel did not
give satisfaction and was repeatedly examined.</p>

<p>“A large number of the female prisoners still
refuse to eat their barley soup,” says the governor
in his journal on the 23rd April, 1817, “several
female prisoners demanding an increase of half a
pound of bread,” being refractory. Next day some
of them refused to begin work, saying they were
half-starved.</p>

<p>Mary Turner was the first prisoner released. She
was supposed to be cured of the criminal taint.
Having equipped her in her liberty clothing, “she
was taken into the several airing grounds in which
were her late fellow-prisoners. The visitor (Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Archibald Macdonald) represented to them in a
most impressive manner the benefits that would
result to themselves by good behaviour. The whole
were most sensibly affected, and the event,” he
says, “will have a very powerful effect on the conduct
of many and prove an incentive to observe
good and orderly demeanour.”</p>

<p>Next day all of the female prisoners appeared
at their cell windows, and shouted vociferously as
Mary Turner went off. This is but one specimen
of the free and easy system of management. Of the
same character was a petition presented by a number
of the female prisoners, to restore to favour two
other convicts who had been punished by the committee.
Indeed, the whole place appears to have
been like a big school, and a degree of license was
allowed to the prisoners consorting little with their
character of convicted criminals.</p>

<p>This mistaken leniency could end but in one way.
Early in the spring the whole of the inmates broke
out in open mutiny. Their alleged grievance was
the issue of an inferior kind of bread. Change of
dietary scales in prisons is always attended with
some risk of disturbance, even when discipline is
most rigorously maintained. In those early days
of mild government riot was, of course, inevitable.
The committee having thought fit to alter the character
of the flour supplied, soon afterwards, at
breakfast-time, all the prisoners, male and female,
refused to receive their bread. The women complained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of its coarseness; and all alike, in spite of
the exhortations of the visitor, Mr. Holford, left it
outside their cell doors. Next day, Sunday, the
bread was at first taken, then thrown out into the
passages. The governor determined to have Divine
Service as usual, but to provide against what might
happen, deposited within his pew “three brace of
pistols loaded with ball.” To make matters worse,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer arrived with a
party of friends to attend the service. The governor
(Mr. Shearman’s successor) immediately
pointed out that he was apprehensive that in consequence
of the newly adopted bread the prisoners’
conduct would not be as orderly as it had ordinarily
been. At first the male prisoners were satisfied by
raising and letting fall the flaps of the kneeling
benches with a loud report, and throwing loaves
about in the body of the chapel, while the women
in an audible tone cried out, “Give us our daily
bread.” Soon after the commencement of the communion
service, the women seated in the gallery
became more loudly clamorous, calling out most
vociferously, “Better bread, better bread!” The
men below, in the body of the church, now rose
and stood upon the benches; but again seated themselves
on a gesture from the governor, who then addressed
them, begging them to keep quiet. Among
the women, the confusion and tumult was continued,
and was increased by the screams of alarm
from the more peaceable. Many fainted, and others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
in great terror entreated to be taken away. These
were suffered to go out in small bodies, in charge
of the officers, and so continuously removed, until
all of the women had been withdrawn. About six
of them, as they came to the place where they could
see the men, made a halt and most boisterously assailed
them, calling them cowards, and such other
opprobrious names. After the women had gone the
service proceeded without further interruption,
after which the Chancellor of the Exchequer (who
was present throughout) addressed the men, giving
them a most appropriate admonition, but praising
their orderly demeanour, which he promised to
report to the Secretary of State. Afternoon service
was performed without the female congregation,
and was uninterrupted except by a few hisses from
the boys.</p>

<p>Next morning the governor informed the whole
of the prisoners, one by one, that the new brown
bread would have to be continued until the meeting
of the committee; whereupon many resisted when
their cell doors were being shut, and others hammered
loudly on the woodwork with their three-legged
stools; and this was accompanied by the
most hideous shouts and yells. In one of the divisions,
four prisoners, who were in the same cell,
were especially refractory, “entirely demolishing
the inner door, every article of furniture, the two
windows and their iron frames; and, having
knocked off large fragments from the stone of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
doorway, threw the pieces at, and smashed to atoms
the passage windows opposite.” One of them, by
name Greenslade, assaulted the governor, on entering
the cell, with part of the door frame; but he
parried the blow, drove the prisoner’s head against
the wall, and was also compelled, in self-defence, to
knock down one Michael Sheen. Such havoc and
destruction was accomplished by the prisoners, that
the governor repaired to the Home Secretary’s office
for assistance. Directed by him to Bow Street,
he brought back a number of runners, and posted
them in various parts of the building, during which
a huge stone was hurled at his head by a prisoner
named Jarman, but without evil consequences. A
fresh din broke out on the ringing of the bell on the
following morning, and neither governor nor chaplain
could permanently allay the tumult; the governor
determined thereupon to handcuff all the
turbulent males immediately. The effect was instantaneous.
Although there were still mumblings
and grumblings, it was evident that the storm would
soon be over. In the course of the day all the refractory
were placed in irons, and all was quiet in
the male pentagon. Yet many still muttered, and
all was still far from quiet. There was little doubt
at the time that a general rising of the men was contemplated,
and the governor felt it necessary to use
redoubled efforts to make all secure, calling in
further assistance from Bow Street. The night
passed, however, without any outbreak, and next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
morning all the prisoners were pretty quiet and orderly.
Later in the day the committee met and sentenced
the ringleaders to various punishments,
chiefly reduction in class, and by this time the whole
were humble and submissive. Finally five, who had
been conspicuous for good conduct, were pardoned.</p>

<p>It is satisfactory to find that the committee firmly
resisted all efforts to make them withdraw the objectionable
bread, and acted on the whole with
spirit and determination. How far the governor
was to blame cannot clearly be made out, but the
confidence of the committee was evidently shaken,
and a month or two later he was called upon to
resign. He refused; whereupon the committee informed
him that they gave him “full credit for his
capacity and talents in his former line of life, but
did not deem he had the talent, temper, or turn of
mind, necessary for the beneficial execution of the
office of governor of the institution.” There was
not the slightest imputation against his moral character,
the committee assured him; but they could
not retain him. He would not resign, and they
were consequently compelled to remove him from
office.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt but that Millbank in these
early days was over much governed. The committee
took everything into their own hands, and
allowed but little latitude to their responsible officers.
Governor Shearman complained the visitors
(members of the committee) who, he says,
“went to the Penitentiary, and gave orders and
directions for things to be done by inferior officers,
which I thought ought to come through me....
Prisoners were occasionally removed from one
ward to another, and I knew nothing of it&mdash;no
communication was made to me; and if the inferior
officers had a request to make, they got too much
into the habit of reserving it to speak to the visitors;
so that I conceived I was almost a nonentity
in the situation.” The prisoners, even, were in the
habit of saying they would wait till the visitor
came, and would ask him for what they wanted,
ignoring the governor altogether. Indeed it appears
from the official journals that the visitors
were constantly at the prison. A Mr. Holford admits
that “for a considerable time he did everything
but sleep there.” But their excuse was that
they were not fortunate in their choice of some of
their first officers; and knew therefore they must
watch vigilantly over their conduct, to keep those
who fulfilled expectations, and to part with those
who appeared unfit for their situations. Besides
which it was necessary to see from time to time how
the rules first framed worked in practice, and what
customs that grew up should be prohibited, and
what sanctioned, by the committee, and adopted
into the rules.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the committee do not
appear to have been well served by all their subordinates.
The governors were changed frequently;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the first “expected to find his place better in point
of emolument, and did not calculate upon the degree
of activity to be expected in the person at the
head of such an establishment; the second was
not thought by the committee to have those habits
of mind&mdash;particularly those habits of conciliation&mdash;which
are required in a person at the head of
such an establishment;” the third was seized with
an affection of the brain, and was never afterwards
capable of exercising sufficient activity. The first
master manufacturer, who as will be remembered
was appointed because he was of a mechanical turn
of mind, was removed because he was a very young
man, and his conduct was not thought steady
enough for the post he occupied. The first steward
was charged with embezzlement, but was actually
dismissed for borrowing money from some of the
tradesmen of the establishment. The first matron
was also sent away within the first twelve months,
but she appears to have been rather hardly used,
although her removal also proves the existence of
grave irregularities in the establishment. The case
against Mrs. Chambers was that she employed certain
of the female prisoners for her own private
advantage. Her daughter was about to be married;
and to assist in making up bed furniture a
portion of thread belonging to the establishment
was used by the prisoners, who gave also their time.
The thread was worth a couple of shillings, and
was replaced by Mrs. Chambers. A second charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
against the matron was for stealing a Penitentiary
Bible. Her excuse was that a number had been
distributed among the officers,&mdash;presents, as she
thought, from the committee,&mdash;and she had passed
hers on to her daughter. But for these offences,
when substantiated, she was dismissed from her
employment.</p>

<p>Entries made in the Visitors’ Journal, however,
are fair evidence that matters were allowed by the
officials to manage themselves in rather a happy-go-lucky
fashion. One day new prisoners were
expected from Newgate; but nothing was ready
for them. “Not a table or a stool in any working
cell; and one of those cells where the prisoners
were to be placed, in which the workmen had some
time since kept coals, was in the dirty state in which
it had been left by them. Not a single bed had been
aired.” The steward did not know these prisoners
were expected, and had ordered no rations for them.
But he stated he had enough, all but about two
pounds. Upon which the visitor remarks, “If sixteen
male prisoners can be supplied without notice,
within two pounds, the quantity of meat sent in
cannot be very accurate.” Again, the visitor finds
the doors from the prison into the hexagon where
the superior officers lived “not double-locked as
they ought to be, and two prisoners together in the
kitchen without a turnkey.” The daily allowance
of food issued to the prisoners was not the right
weight. He says: “There are in the bathing-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
at the lodge several bundles of clothes belonging
to male prisoners who have come in between the 1st
and 21st of this month; they are exactly in the
state in which they were when the subject was
mentioned to the committee last week; some of
them are thrown into a dirty part of the room&mdash;whether
intended to be burned I do not know; the
porter thinks they are not. I do not believe any
of the female prisoners’ things have been yet sold.
I understand from the governor he has not yet
made any entry in the character-book concerning
the behaviour of any male prisoner since he came
into the prison, or relative to any occurrence connected
with such prisoner.”</p>

<p>All this will fairly account for any extra fussiness
on the part of the committee. Doubtful of the zeal
and energy of those to whom they confided the
details of management, they were continually stepping
in to make up for any shortcomings by their
own activity. But the direct consequence of this
interference was to shake the authority of the ostensible
heads. Moreover, to make the more sure
that nothing should be neglected, and no irregularity
overlooked, the committee encouraged, or at
least their most prominent member did, all sorts of
talebearing, and a system of espionage that must
have been destructive of all good feeling among the
inmates of the prison. Mr. Pitt, when examined by
the Select Committee, said, “Mr. Holford has mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to me: ‘I hear so and so; such and such an
abuse appears to be going forward; but I shall
get some further information.’ I always turned
a deaf ear to these observations, thinking it an
erroneous system, and that it was not likely to
contribute to the good of the establishment.” He
thought that if the committee members were so
ready to lend a willing ear to such communications,
it operated as an encouragement to talebearing;
the consequences of which certainly appeared to
have been disputes, cabals, or intrigues. Mr. Shearman
remarks at some length on the same subject:
“I certainly did think there was a very painful system
going on in the prison against officers, ... by
what I might term ‘spyism.’ I have no doubt it all
arose from the purest motives, thinking it was the
best way to conduct the establishment, setting up
one person to look after another.” The master
manufacturer and the steward in this way took
the opportunity of vilifying the governor; and
there is no doubt the matron, Mrs. Chambers, fell
a victim to this practice. She was the victim of
insinuation, and the evil reports of busybodies who
personally disliked her.</p>

<p>It is easy to imagine the condition of Millbank
then. A small colony apart from the great world;
living more than as neighbours, as one family almost&mdash;but
not happily&mdash;under the same roof.
The officials, nearly all of them of mature age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
having grown-up children, young ladies and young
gentlemen, always about the place, and that place
from its peculiar conditions, like a ship at sea, shut
off from the public, and concentrated on what was
going on within its walls. Gossip, of course, prevalent&mdash;even
malicious; constant observation of one
another, jealousies, quarrels, inevitable when authority
was divided between three people, the governor,
chaplain, and matron, and it was not clearly
made out which was the most worthy; subordinates
ever on the look-out to make capital of the
differences of their betters, and alive to the fact that
they were certain of a hearing when they chose to
carry any slanderous tale, or make any underhand
complaint. For there, outside the prison, was the
active and all-powerful committee, ever ready to
listen, and anxious to get information. One of the
witnesses before the committee of 1823 stated,
“From the earliest period certainly the active members
of the Superintending Committee gave great
encouragement to receive any information from the
subordinate officers, I believe with the view of putting
the prison in its best possible state; that encouragement
was caught with avidity by a great
many, simply for the purpose of cultivating the
good opinion of those gentlemen conducting it;
and I am induced to think that in many instances
their zeal overstepped perhaps the strict line of
truth; for I must say that during the whole period
I was there, there was a continual complaint, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
officer against another, and a system that was quite
unpleasant in an establishment of that nature.”</p>

<p>Of a truth the life inside the Penitentiary must
have been rather irksome to more people than those
confined there against their will.</p>

the Prisoners&mdash;Virulent disorder attacks them&mdash;The result

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> internal organization of Millbank, which
has been detailed in the last chapter, is described
at some length in a Blue Book, bearing date July,
1823. But though Millbank was then, so to speak,
on its trial, and its value, in return for the enormous
cost of its erection, closely questioned, it is
probable that its management would not have demanded
a Parliamentary inquiry but for one serious
mishap which brought matters to a crisis. Of a
sudden the whole of the inmates of the prison began
to pine and fall away. A virulent disorder
broke out, and threatened the lives of all in the
place. Alarm and misgiving in such a case soon
spread; and all at once the public began to fear
that Millbank was altogether a huge mistake. Here
was a building upon which half a million had
been spent, and now, when barely completed, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
proved uninhabitable! Money cast wholesale into
a deadly swamp, and all the fine talk of reformation
and punishment to give way to coroners’ inquests
and deaths by a strange disease. No wonder there
was a cry for investigation. Then, as on many subsequent
occasions, it became evident Millbank was
fulfilling one of the conditions laid down as of
primary importance in the choice of site. Howard
had said that the Penitentiary House must be built
near the metropolis, so as to insure constant supervision
and inspection. Millbank is ten minutes’
walk from Westminster, and from the first has
been the subject of continual inquiry and legislation.
The tons of Blue Books and dozens of Acts
of Parliament which it has called into existence will
be sufficient proof of this. It was, however, a public
undertaking, carried out in the full blaze of daylight,
and hence it attracted more than ordinary
attention. What might have passed unnoticed in a
far-off shire, was in London magnified to proportions
almost absurd. This must explain state interference,
which now-a-days may seem quite unnecessary,
and will account for giving a national
importance to matters oftentimes in themselves
really trivial.</p>

<p>But this first sickness in the Penitentiary was sufficiently
serious to arrest attention, and call for
description in detail.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1822, the physicians appointed
to report on the subject state that the general health<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of the prisoners in Millbank began visibly to decline.
They became pale and languid, thin and
feeble; those employed in tasks calling for bodily
exertion could not execute the same amount of
work as before, those at the mill ground less corn,
those at the pump brought up less water, the laundry-women
often fainted at their work, and the
regular routine of the place was only accomplished
by constantly changing the hands engaged.
Throughout the winter this was the general condition
of the prisoners. The breaking down of health
was shown by such symptoms as lassitude, dejection
of spirits, paleness of countenance, rejection of
food, and occasional faintings. Yet, with all this
depression of general health, there were no manifest
signs of specific disease; the numbers in hospital
were not in excess of previous winters, and
their maladies were such as were commonly incident
to cold weather. But in January, 1823, scurvy&mdash;unmistakable
sea scurvy&mdash;made its appearance,
and was then recognized as such, and in its true
form, for the first time by the medical superintendent,
though the prisoners themselves declared it was
visible among them as early as the previous November.
Being anxious to prevent alarm, either in
the Penitentiary itself or in the neighbourhood, the
medical officer rather suppressed the fact of the
existence of the disease; and this, with a certain
tendency to make light of it, led to the omission
of many precautions. But there it was, plainly evident;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
first, by the usual sponginess of the gums,
then by “ecchymosed” blotches on the legs, which
were observed in March to be pretty general among
the prisoners.</p>

<p>Upon this point, the physicians called in remarked
that the scurvy spots were at their first
appearance peculiarly apt to escape discovery, unless
the attention be particularly directed towards them,
and that they often existed for a long time entirely
unnoticed by the patient himself. And now with
the scurvy came dysentery, and diarrhœa, of the
peculiar kind that is usually associated with the
scorbutic disease. In all cases, the same constitutional
derangement was observable, the outward
marks of which were a sallow countenance and
impaired digestion, diminished muscular strength,
a feeble circulation, various degrees of nervous affections,
such as tremors, cramps, or spasms, and various
degrees of mental despondency.</p>

<p>With regard to the extent of the disease, it was
found that quite half of the total number were
affected, the women more extensively than the men;
and both the males and females of the second class,
or those who had been longest in confinement, were
more frequently attacked than the newest arrivals.
Some few were, however, entirely exempt; more
especially the prisoners employed in the kitchen,
while among the officers and their families, amounting
in all to one hundred and six individuals, there
was not a single instance of attack recorded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Such then was the condition of the prisoners in
the Penitentiary in the spring of 1823. To what
was this sudden outbreak of a virulent disorder to
be traced? There were those who laid the whole
blame on the locality, and who would admit of no
other explanation. But this argument was in the
first instance opposed by the doctors investigating.
Had the situation of the prison been at fault, they
said, it was only reasonable to suppose that the disease
would have shown itself in earlier years of the
prison’s existence; whereas, as far as they could
ascertain, till 1822-3 it was altogether unknown.
Moreover, had this been the real cause, all inmates
would alike have suffered; how then explain the
universal immunity of the officers in charge?
Again, if it were the miasmata arising upon a
marshy neighbourhood that militated against the
healthiness of the prison, there should be prevalent
other diseases which marsh miasmata confessedly
engender. Besides which, the scurvy and diarrhœa
thus produced are associated with intermittent
fevers, in this case not noticeable; and they would
have occurred during the hot instead of the winter
season. Lastly, if it were imagined that the dampness
of the situation had contributed to the disease,
a ready answer was, that on examination every
part of the prison was found to be singularly dry,
not the smallest stain of moisture being apparent in
any cell or passage, floor, ceiling, or wall.</p>

<p>But indeed it was not necessary to search far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
afield for the causes of the outbreak; they lay
close at hand. Undoubtedly a sudden and somewhat
ill-judged reduction in diet was entirely to
blame. For a long time the luxury of the Penitentiary
had been a standing joke. The prison was
commonly called Mr. Holford’s fattening house.
He was told that much money might be saved the
public by parting with half his officers, for there
need be no fear of escapes; all that was needed was
a proper guard to prevent too great a rush of people
in. An honourable member published a pamphlet
in which he styled the dietary at Millbank “an insult
to honest industry, and a violation of common
sense.” And evidence was not wanting from the
prison itself of the partial truth of these allegations.
The medical superintendent frequently reported that
the prisoners, especially the females, suffered from
plethora, and from diseases consequent upon a fulness
of habit. Great quantities of food were carried
out of the prison in the wash-tubs; potatoes,
for instance, were taken to the pigs, which Mr. Holford
admitted he would have been ashamed to have
seen thus carried out of his own house. It came
to such a pass at last that the committee was plainly
told by members of the House of Commons, that
if the dietary were not changed, the next annual
vote for the establishment would probably be opposed.
In the face of all this clamour the committee
could not hold out; but in their anxiety to
provide a remedy, they went from one extreme to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the other. Abandoning the scale that was too plentiful,
they substituted one that was altogether too
meagre. In the new dietary solid animal food was
quite excluded, and only soup was given. This
soup was made of ox heads, in the proportion of
one to every hundred prisoners; it was to be thickened
with vegetables or peas, and the daily allowance
was to be a quart, half at midday, and half in
the evening. The bread ration was a pound and
a half, and for breakfast there was also a pint of
gruel. It was open to the committee to substitute
potatoes for bread if they saw fit, but they do not
seem to have done this. The meat upon an ox head
averages about eight pounds, so that the allowance
per prisoner was about an ounce and a quarter. No
wonder then that they soon fell away in health.</p>

<p>The mere reduction in the amount of food, however,
would not have been sufficient in itself to cause
the epidemic of scurvy. Scurvy will occur even with
a copious dietary. Sailors who eat plenty of biscuit
and beef are attacked, and others who are
certainly not starved. The real predisposing cause
is the absence of certain necessary elements in the
diet, not the lowness of the diet itself. It is the
want of vegetable acids in food that brings about
the mischief. The authorities called in were not
exactly right, therefore, in attributing the scurvy
solely to the reduced diet. The siege of Gibraltar
was quoted as an instance where semi-starvation
superinduced the disease. Again, the scurvy prevalent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in the low districts round Westminster was
traced to a similar deficiency and the severe winter,
also to the want of vegetable diet. This last was
the real explanation; of this, according to our medical
knowledge, there is not now the faintest doubt.
Long enforced abstinence from fresh meat and
fresh vegetables is certain sooner or later to produce
scurvy. At the same time it must be admitted
that the epidemic of which I am writing was aggravated
by the cold weather. It had its origin in the
cold season, and its progress kept pace with it, continued
through the spring, actually increasing with
summer.</p>

<p>During the months of May and June the disorder
was progressive, but the early part of July
saw a diminution in the numbers afflicted. At this
time the prison population amounted to about eight
hundred.</p>

<p>There was a total of thirty deaths. In spite of
this slight improvement for the better, it is easy to
understand that the medical men in charge were
still much troubled with fears for the future. Granting
even that the disease had succumbed to treatment,
there was the danger, with all the prisoners
in a low state of health, of relapse, or even of an
epidemic in a new shape. Hence it was felt that
an immediate change of air and place would be
the best security against further disease. But several
hundred convicts could not be sent to the seaside
like ordinary convalescents; besides which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
they were committed to Millbank by Act of Parliament,
and only by Act of Parliament could they
be removed. This difficulty was easily met. An
Act of Parliament more or less made no matter
to Millbank&mdash;many pages in the statute book were
covered already with legislation for the Penitentiary.
A new act was immediately passed, authorizing
the committee to transfer the prisoners from
Millbank to situations more favourable for the recovery
of their health. In accordance with its provisions
one part of the female prisoners were at once
sent into the Royal Ophthalmic Hospital in Regent’s
Park, at that time standing empty; their number
during July and August was increased to one hundred
and twenty, by which time a hulk, the <i>Ethalion</i>,
had been prepared at Woolwich for male convicts,
and thither went two hundred, towards the
end of August. Those selected for removal were
the prisoners who had suffered most from the disease.
This was an experiment; and according to
its results the fate of those who remained at Millbank
was to be determined. “The benefit of the
change of air and situation,” says Dr. Latham,
“was immediately apparent.” Within a fortnight
there was less complaint of illness, and most of the
patients already showed symptoms of returning
health. Meanwhile, among the prisoners left at
Millbank there was little change, though at times
all were threatened with a return of the old disorder,
less virulent in its character, however, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
missing half its former frightful forms. By September,
a comparison between those at Regent’s
Park or the hulk and those still in Millbank was so
much in favour of the former that the point at
issue seemed finally settled. Beyond doubt the
change of air had been extremely beneficial; nevertheless,
of the two changes, it was evident that the
move to the hulks at Woolwich had the better of
the change to Regent’s Park. On board the <i>Ethalion</i>
the prisoners had suffered fewer relapses and
had gained a greater degree of health than those
at Regent’s Park. On the whole, therefore, it was
considered advisable to complete the process of
emptying Millbank. The men and women alike
were all drafted into different hulks off Woolwich.
These changes were carried out early in December,
1823, and by that time the Millbank Penitentiary
was entirely emptied, and it remained vacant till
the summer of the next year.</p>

<p>The inner life of the Penitentiary went on much
as usual in the early days of the epidemic. There
are at first only the ordinary entries in the governor’s
Journal. Prisoners came and went; this
one was pardoned, that received from Newgate or
some county gaol. Repeated reports of misconduct
are recorded. The prisoners seemed fretful and
mischievous. Now and then they actually complained
of the want of food. One prisoner was
taken to task for telling his father, in the visiting
cell, that six prisoners out of every seven would die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
for want of rations. But at length the blow fell.
On the 14th February, 1823, Ann Smith died in
the infirmary at half-past nine. On the 17th, Mary
Ann Davidson; on the 19th, Mary Esp; on the
23rd, William Cardwell; on the 24th, Humphrey
Adams; on the 28th, Margaret Patterson. And
now, by order of the visitor, the prisoners were
allowed more walking exercise. Then follow the
first steps taken by Drs. Roget and Latham. The
governor records, on the 3rd March, that the doctors
recommend each prisoner should have daily
four ounces of meat and three oranges; that their
bread should be divided into three parts, an orange
taken at each meal. Accordingly the steward was
sent to Thames Street to lay in a week’s consumption
of oranges.</p>

<p>An entry soon afterwards gives the first distinct
reference to the epidemic. “The medical gentlemen
having begged for the bodies of such prisoners
as might die of the disorder now prevalent in
the prison, in order to make post-mortem examinations,
the same was sanctioned if the friends of the
prisoner did not wish to interfere.” Deaths were
now very frequent, and hardly a week passed without
a visit from the coroner or his deputy.</p>

<p>On the 25th of March the governor, Mr. Couch,
who had been ailing for some time past, resigned
his charge into the hands of Captain Benjamin
Chapman. Soon afterwards there were further additions
to the dietary&mdash;on the 26th of April two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
more ounces of meat and twelve ounces of boiled
potatoes; and the day after, it was ordered that
each prisoner should drink toast-and-water,&mdash;three
half-pints daily. Lime, in large tubs, was
to be provided in all the pentagons for the purpose
of disinfection.</p>

<p>About this period there was a great increase of
insubordination among the prisoners. It is easy
to understand that discipline must be relaxed when
all were more or less ailing and unable to bear
punishment. The sick wards were especially noisy
and turbulent. One man, for instance, was charged
with shouting loudly and using atrocious language;
all of which, of course, he denied, declaring he had
only said, “God bless the king, my tongue is very
much swelled.” Upon this the turnkey in charge
observed that it was a pity it was not swelled more,
and Smith (the prisoner) pursued the argument
by hitting his officer on the head with a pint pot.
Later on they broke out almost into mutiny. The
governor writes as follows: “At a quarter to eight
o’clock Taskmaster Swift informed me that the
whole of the prisoners in the infirmary ward of his
pentagon were in the most disorderly and riotous
state, in consequence of the wooden doors of the
cells having been ordered by the surgeon to be shut
during the night; that the prisoners peremptorily
refused to permit the turnkeys to shut their doors,
and made use of the most opprobrious terms, threatening
destruction to whoever might attempt to shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
their doors. Their shouts and yells were so loud as
to be heard at a considerable distance. I immediately
summoned the patrols, and several of the
turnkeys, and making them take their cutlasses, I
repaired to the sick ward. I found the wooden
doors all open, and the prisoners, for the most part,
at their iron gates, which were shut. The first prisoner
I came to was John Hall. I asked him the
reason he refused to shut his door when ordered.
He answered in a very insolent tone and manner,
‘Why should I do so?’ I then said, ‘Shut your
door instantly,’ but he would not comply. I took
him away and confined him in a dark cell. In conveying
him to the cell he made use of most
abusive and threatening language, but did not make
any personal resistance.” Five others who were
pointed out as prominent in the mutiny were also
punished on bread and water in a dark cell, by the
surgeon’s permission.</p>

<p>Nor were matters much more satisfactory in the
female infirmary wards. “Mrs. Briant, having
reported yesterday, during my absence at Woolwich,
that Mary Willson had ‘wilfully cut her
shoes,’ and, having stated the same verbally this
morning, I went with her into the infirmary, where
the prisoner was, and having produced the shoes
to her (the upper-leather of one of them being palpably
cut from the sole), and asked her why she cut
them, she said she had not cut them, that they had
come undone whilst walking in the garden. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
being an evident falsehood, I told her I feared she
was doing something worse than cutting her shoes
by telling an untruth. She answered in a very saucy
manner, they were not her shoes, and that she had
not cut them. She became at length very insolent,
when I told her she deserved to be punished. She
replied she did not care whether she was or not. I
then directed the surgeon to be sent for; when not
only the prisoner, but several others in the infirmary,
became very clamorous, and evinced a great
degree of insubordination. I went out with the intention
of getting a couple of patrols, when I heard
the crash of broken glass and loud screams. I returned
as soon as possible with the patrols into the
infirmary. The women generally attempted to oppose
my entrance, and a group had got Willson
amongst them, and said she should not be confined.
I desired the patrols to lay hold of her, and take her
to the dark cell (I had met with Dr. Hugh when
going for the patrols, who under the circumstances
sanctioned the removal of the prisoner). In doing
so, Betts and Stone were assaulted with the utmost
violence; I myself was violently laid hold of, and
my wrist and finger painfully twisted. I had Willson,
however, taken to the dark cell, when, having
summoned several of the turnkeys and officers of
the prison, I with considerable difficulty succeeded
in taking six more of them who appeared to be most
forward in this disgraceful riot. Several of the
large panes in the passage windows were broken;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and the women seized everything they could lay
their hands on, and flung them at the officers, who,
in self-defence, were at length compelled to strike
in return. I immediately reported the circumstance
to Sir George Farrant, the visitor, who came to the
prison soon after. I accompanied him, with Dr.
Bennett (the chaplain) and Mr. Pratt (the surgeon),
through the female pentagon and infirmary,
when a strong spirit of insubordination was obvious.
Sir George addressed them, and so did Dr. Bennett,
and pointed out the serious injury they were doing
themselves, and that such conduct would not pass
unpunished. We afterwards visited the dark refractory
cells, where the worst were confined; two of
whom, on account of previous good-conduct and
favourable circumstances, were liberated. For myself,
I never beheld such a scene of outrage, nor did
I observe a single individual who was not culpably
active.”</p>

<p>As a general rule, the prisoners in the Penitentiary
were in these days so little looked after, and
had so much leisure time, that they soon found the
proverbial mischief for idle hands. Having some
suspicions, the governor searched several, and found
up the sleeves of five of them, knives, playing cards
(made from an old copy-book), two articles to hold
ink, a baby’s straw hat, some papers (written
upon), and an original song of questionable tendency.
The hearts and diamonds in the cards had
been covered with red chalk, the clubs and spades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
with blacking. “Having received information that
there were more cards about, he caused strict search
to be made, and found in John Brown’s Bible, one
card and the materials for making more, also a
small knife made of bone. In another prisoner’s
cell was found another knife and some paste, ingeniously
contrived from old bread-crumbs.” But
even these amusements did not keep the prisoners
from continually quarrelling and fighting with one
another. Any one who had made himself obnoxious
was severely handled. A body of prisoners fell
upon one Tompkins, and half killed him because
he had reported the irreverent conduct of several
of them while at divine service. The place was
like a bear-garden; insubordination, riots, foul language,
and continual wranglings among themselves&mdash;it
could hardly be said that the prisoners were
making that rapid progress towards improvement
which was among the principal objects of the Penitentiary.</p>

<p>And now the scene shifts to the Woolwich hulks,
whither by this time the whole of the inmates were
being by degrees transferred. The first batch of
males were sent off on the 16th August, embarking
at Millbank, and proceeding by launch to
Woolwich. Great precautions were taken. All
the disposable taskmasters, turnkeys, and patrols
being armed and stationed from the outer lodge
to the quay (River Stairs), the prisoners were
assembled by six at a time, and placed without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
irons in the launch. The same plan was pursued
from time to time, till at length the entire number
were removed. The hulks were the <i>Ethalion</i>, <i>Narcissus</i>,
<i>Dromedary</i>. A master was on board in
charge of each, under the general supervision of
Captain Chapman, the governor of the Penitentiary.
There was immediately a further great deterioration
in the conduct of the prisoners. Not only were they
mischievous, as appeared from their favourite pastime,
which was to drag off one another’s bedclothes
in the middle of the night, by means of a
crooked nail attached to a long string, but the decks
which they occupied were for ever in a state of anarchy
and confusion. “All the prisoners below,”
says the overseer of the <i>Ethalion</i>, “conducted themselves
last night in a most improper manner, by
singing obscene songs and making a noise. When
summoned to appear on the upper deck, they treated
the master with defiance and contempt, so that the
ringleaders had to be put in irons.” But it was a
mere waste of time to confine prisoners below.
There was no place of security to hold them. “A
number of prisoners broke their confinement by
forcibly removing the boards of the different cabins
in which they were placed in the cockpit, and got
together in the fore hold, where they were found
by Mr. Lodge at half-past nine at night.” Another
prisoner, a day or two later, confined in the hold,
broke out, and proceeded through the holds and
wings of the ship till he arrived at the fore hold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
where another prisoner, Connor, was confined for
irreverent behaviour during chapel. Connor tore
up the boards fastened on to the mast-hatch, and
admitted Williams to him. “When Williams’ escape
was discovered,” says the overseer, “I
searched for him in the bottom of the ship. On
my arriving at the bulkhead of the fore hold I inquired
of Connor if Williams was with him. He
declared he was not, calling on God to witness his
assertion; but on opening the hatch, to my astonishment
I found him there. I ordered him back to
the place in which he was first confined; on which
he used the most abusive language, saying, by God,
when he was released he would murder me and
every officer in the ship. I talked mildly to him,
and desired him to return to the place in which he
had been confined. He at last complied, using the
most abusive and threatening language. When he
had returned to the after hold, I put the leg-irons
on him to prevent his forcing out a second time, giving
him at the same time to understand, that if he
would behave himself they would soon be taken off.
But he was still turbulent, breaking everything before
him. I then put handcuffs on him, notwithstanding
which he broke out at 9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, disengaged
himself from the handcuffs, and got a second time
to the fore hold, where I again found him, and insisted
on his returning. He kicked me very much in
the legs, using, as before, threatening language. I
then found it necessary to use force, and taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
guards Wadeson and Clarke with the steward, we
again removed him to his first place of confinement.
He appeared so resolute and determined to commit
further depredations, that I fastened his leg-irons
to a five-inch staple in the timber of the hold, which
staple he tore up during the night, and again passed
to Connor in the fore hold.”</p>

<p>On the 27th November it was found that some
prisoners had made their escape from the <i>Ethalion</i>
hulk. On mustering the prisoners in the morning
three were missing. Search was immediately made,
but they were not to be found. All the hatches on
the lower deck were secure; but it was ascertained,
on examination of the after hold, that the prisoners
must have made their way into the steward’s store-room,
where they had taken out the window. One
of them then swam off to the <i>Shear</i> hulk, secured
the boat, brought it to the after windows, and by
that means, assisting each other, the three effected
their escape. The boat belonging to the <i>Shear</i> hulk
was found at the Prince Regent’s Ferry House,
on the Essex coast. After a close investigation it
was not possible to bring the blame home to any
one. All the guards proved, of course, that they were
on the alert all night. The steward said he had had
a blister on, and could not sleep a wink, but he never
missed hearing the bell struck (by the watch) every
quarter of an hour. Stevenson, one of those who
had escaped, had always been employed in the
steward’s store-room, hence he knew his way about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the ship. Being a sailor and a good swimmer, it
was probably he who had gone to the <i>Shear</i> hulk
and got a boat, taking with him one end of a rope
made of hammock nettings, the other being fast to
a beam in the store-room. By this rope the <i>Shear</i>
hulk boat was hauled gently to the <i>Ethalion</i>; then
the other two prisoners got into it, and it was allowed
to drift down for some distance with the tide.
No sound whatever of oars had been heard during
the night by the sentries on board or on shore.
The escape must have been made between one and
two o’clock in the morning, as at three the men
were seen landing from a boat on the Essex coast.</p>

<p>Information of the escape soon spread among
the other prisoners, and it was pretty certain that
many would attempt to follow. They were reported
to be ripe for any mischief. The fire-arms were
carefully inspected by the governor, who insisted
on their being kept constantly in good order and
“well flinted.” At the same time a strict search
was made through the ship, particularly of the
lower deck, for any implements that might be secreted
to facilitate escape. False keys were reported
to be in existence, but none could be found; only
a large sledge-hammer, a ripping chisel, and some
iron bolts which were concealed in the caboose. A
few days afterwards the master of the <i>Ethalion</i>
reported the discovery of a number of other dangerous
articles in various parts of the ship, several
more sledge-hammers, chisels, iron bars, spike nails,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
etc., all calculated to do much mischief, and endanger
the safety of the ship. At the same time, four
prisoners were overheard planning another escape.
They were to steal the key of a closet on the deck,
and alter it so as to fit the locks of the bulk heads
into the infirmary wards, and pass by this means
to the cabin, and out through one of the ports.
The key was immediately impounded, and a strict
watch kept all night. Between eleven and twelve
the guard reported that he heard a noise like filing
through iron bars; so the master got into a boat
with two others and rowed round the ship. They
were armed with a cutlass and blunderbus, “which,”
says the master, “I particularly requested might
be put out of sight.” But everything was perfectly
quiet on the lower deck, and on going through the
upper deck the only discovery made was a prisoner
sitting by a lamp, manufacturing a draught board,
which he refused to part with. They left the deck
quite quiet; yet at half-past three the whole place
was in an uproar. A regular stand-up fight took
place between two prisoners, Elgar and Blore, in
which the former got his eyes blackened and face
damaged in the most shameful manner. This
Elgar was the man who gave information of the
projected escape, thereby incurring the resentment
of the rest. It is improbable, however, that any
attempt was actually intended this time, though
escape was in every mouth, and had been since the
event of the previous Thursday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Speaking of the hulks at this time, the governor
says, “It is but too true that little if any discipline
exists among the prisoners, and that the state of
insubordination is extremely alarming. This may,
in a great degree, be attributed to the lamentable
state of idleness, the facility of communicating with
each other, concerning and perpetrating mischief,
and the inadequate means of punishment when contrasted
with the hulks establishment.”</p>

<p>But by this time news had come of the missing
three. At nine o’clock one night a person called
at the Penitentiary and asked to see the governor
in private. He was shown into the office. “You
had three prisoners escape from Woolwich lately?
One of them is my brother, Charles Knight. I
am very anxious he should be brought back. What
is the penalty for escaping?” He was informed;
also that there was a charge of stealing from the
steward’s store. Knight’s brother said he would
willingly pay the damage of that, and wished to
make conditions for the fugitive if he was given up.
The governor would not promise beyond an assurance
of speaking in Knight’s favour to the committee;
and said all would depend upon his making
a full and candid disclosure of all the circumstances
connected with the escape, and giving all the information
in his power which would lead to the
arrest of the other two. The visitor then observed
that his brother was very young, and by no means
a hardened offender; that he was led into this act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and was sorry for it; that none of his relations
would harbour him, and that he was quite ready to
return. Next morning he was brought back by his
mother and brother, and gave immediately a full
account of the affair. The escape had been concerted
a full week before it was carried into effect,
and had been arranged entirely by Stevenson, who
having been employed in the store-room, had purloined
a key, filed out the wards and made a skeleton
key, with which he opened the hatches. The
rope was made out of spun yarn, found in the hold
by Stevenson, who also got there the sledge-hammer,
chisel, and iron spikes. There was not a soul
moving or awake on the lower deck, and no one
knew of their intention to escape. They then got
away in a boat, just as had been surmised. On
landing at the new ferry on the Essex coast, they
went across the chain pier, Payne changing a shilling
to pay the toll. This was all the money they
had amongst them, and had been conveyed to Payne
by some person in the ship. They then proceeded
to London, and were supplied with hats by a Jew
named Wolff, living in Somerset Street, Whitechapel,
to whose house they were taken by Stevenson.
Afterwards they went to the West End.
Payne separated from them in Waterloo Place, saying
he meant to go to a brother living at Stratford-on-Avon.
Stevenson then took Knight to his
brother’s, who was a working jeweller, and who
gave them money to buy clothes. They hid together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
for the night in a house in George Street,
St. Giles; and then Knight went home to his aunt’s
in Hanover Street, Long Acre, but was refused
admittance. The same happened with all his other
relatives, and at last he was compelled to give himself
up in the manner described. Through information
which he gave the others also were apprehended.</p>

<p>The numbers on board the several ships at this
time were over six hundred; they were not classified;
the distinctions of the Penitentiary, as well as
the dress, were done away with. All alike were
clothed in a coarse brown suit. They were kept
in divisions of seventy-five, with a wardsman in
charge of each division; besides which, a number
of well-conducted prisoners were appointed to keep
watch during the night, who were to report any
irregularity that might occur during the watch.
There was no employment for the prisoners: the
making of great-coats was tried, but it did not succeed.
There was no work to be got on shore, and
it was doubtful whether these prisoners could be
legally employed for that. In fact the whole establishment
was considered a sort of house of recovery,
and all the prisoners were more or less under hospital
treatment throughout. The general conduct
of the prisoners was “unruly to a degree, and in
some instances to the extent of mutiny.” This continued
month after month through the winter till
well into the spring of 1824, when for a time, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the conduct of all improved. They were in hopes
that they were about to get some remission of their
sentences, and feared lest misconduct should militate
against their release. They were all in full expectation
that something would be done for them by
Parliament, in consequence of their very great sufferings.
The tenor of all their letters to their
friends was to the same effect. They were, however,
doomed to disappointment; for on the 14th
April, Mr. Kellock states, “This morning I received
information that the bill for the labour and
removal of the male convicts under the Penitentiary
rules, and at present on board the prison ships, had
received the royal assent. When informed that
they were to be removed to labour at the hulks, they
received the news with some degree of surprise and
astonishment.” But the same day the exodus took
place, and they are reported to have gone away
“very quietly and resigned.”</p>

<h3>THE PENITENTIARY REOCCUPIED</h3>

<p class="pch">Improved Ventilation and Drainage&mdash;Revised dietary&mdash;Provision
of Hard Labour&mdash;Mild rule of Governor Chapman&mdash;Constant
warfare between Prisoners and Authorities&mdash;Feigned
suicides&mdash;Repeated Offences&mdash;Turbulence developed

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> pains were spared to make the Penitentiary
wholesome for re-occupation. A Parliamentary
Committee&mdash;that great panacea for all public ills&mdash;had
however already reported favourably upon
the place. They had declared that no case of local
unhealthiness could be made out against it; nor had
they been able to find “anything in the spot on
which the Penitentiary is situated, nor in the construction
of the building itself, nor in the moral and
physical treatment of the prisoners confined therein,
to injure health or render them peculiarly liable to
disease.”</p>

<p>Yet to guard against all danger of relapse, they
advised that none of the old hands should return
to the prison, and recommended also certain external
and internal improvements. Better ventilation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
was needed; to obtain this they called in Sir
Humphrey Davy, and gave him <i>carte blanche</i> to
carry out any alterations. Complete fumigation
was also necessary; and this was effected with
chlorine, under the supervision of a Mr. Faraday
from the Royal Institution. To render innocuous
the dirty ditch of stagnant water&mdash;dignified with
the name of moat&mdash;which surrounded the buildings
just within the boundary wall, it was connected
with the Thames and its tides. Additional stoves
were placed in the several pentagons, and the dietary
reorganized on a full and nutritive scale, in quality
and quantity equal to that in force before the epidemic.
Provision was also made to secure plenty
of hard labour exercise for the prisoners daily, by
increasing the number of crank mills and water
machines in the yards. More schooling was also
recommended, as a profitable method of employing
hours otherwise lost, and breaking in on the monotony
and dreariness of the long dark nights. The
cells, the committee thought too, should be lighted
with candles, and books supplied “of a kind to
combine rational amusement, with moral and religious
instruction.” Indeed there was no limit to
the benevolence of these commissioners. Adverting
to the testimony of the medical men they had
examined, who were agreed that cheerfulness and
innocent recreation were conducive to health, they
submitted for consideration, whether some kind of
games or sports might not be permitted in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
prison during a portion of the day. Fives-courts
and skittle-alleys were probably in their minds, with
cricket in the garden, or football during the winter
weather. As one reads all this, one is tempted to
ask whether the objects of so much tender solicitude
were really convicted felons sentenced to imprisonment
for serious crimes.</p>

<p>The rule of Governor Chapman was essentially
considerate and mild. There was no limit to his
long-suffering and patience. Though by all the
habits of his early life he must have learned to look
at breaches of discipline with no lenient eye, we shall
find that he never punished even the most insubordinate
and contumacious of the ruffians committed
to his charge till he had first exhausted every
method of exhortation or reproof; and when he
had punished he was ever ready to forgive, on a
promise of future amendment, or even a mere hypocritical
expression of contrition alone. It is now
generally admitted that felons cooped up within
four walls can be kept in bounds only under an iron
hand. Captain Chapman acted otherwise, the committee
which controlled him fully endorsing his
views. For a long time to come the prison was like
a bear garden; misconduct was rife in every shape
and form, increasing daily in virulence, till at length
the place might have been likened to Pandemonium
let loose. Then more stringent measures were enforced,
with satisfactory results, as we shall see;
but for many years there was that continuous warfare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
between ruffianism and constituted authority
which is inevitable when the latter savours of weakness
or irresolution.</p>

<p>Feigned suicides were among the earliest methods
of annoyance. It is not easy to explain exactly
what end the prisoners had in view, but doubtless
they hoped to enlist the sympathies of their kindhearted
guardians, by exhibiting a recklessness of
life. Those who preferred death to continued imprisonment
must indeed be miserably unhappy, calling
for increased tenderness and anxious attention.
They must be talked to, petted, patted on the back,
and taken into the infirmary, to be regaled with
dainties, and suffered to lie there in idleness for
weeks. So whenever any prisoner was thwarted
or out of temper, often indeed without rhyme or
reason, and whenever the fancy seized him, he tied
himself up at once to his loom, or laid hands upon
his throat with his dinner-knife, or a bit of broken
glass. Of course their last idea was to succeed.
They took the greatest pains to insure their own
safety, and these were often ludicrously apparent;
but now and then, though rarely, they failed of
their object, and the wretched victim suffered by
mistake. Happily the actually fatal cases were few
and far between.</p>

<p>This fashion of attempting suicide was led by a
certain William Major, who arrived from Newgate
on the 8th October, 1824. A few days afterwards
he confided to the surgeon this determination to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
make away with himself; “that, or murder some
one here; for I’d sooner be hanged like a dog than
stay in the Penitentiary.” Such terrible desperation
called of course for immediate expostulation,
and Captain Chapman proceeded at once to Major’s
cell. The prisoner’s knife and scissors were first
removed; then the governor spoke to him. Major
replied sullenly; adding, “I’ve made up my mind:
I’d do anything to get out of this place; kill myself
or you. I’d sooner go to the gallows than stay
here.” “I reasoned with him,” says Captain Chapman
in his Journal, “for a length of time on the
wickedness of such shocking expressions; telling
him there was only one way of shortening his time,
and that was by good conduct. I told him his
threats were those of a silly lad, which I should
however punish him for.” So Major was carried
off to a dark cell, but not before the governor had
said all he could think of, to reason him out of his
evil frame of mind. He remained in the dark two
days, and then, having expressed himself penitent
and promising faithfully better behaviour, he was released.
For three weeks nothing further occurred,
and then, “Suddenly,” says the governor, “as I
was passing through a neighbouring ward, a turnkey
called to me, ‘Here, here, governor! bring
a knife. Major has hanged himself.” He had made
himself fast to the cross beam of his loom. The action
of his heart had not, however, ceased, though
the circulation was languid and his extremities cold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
He was removed at once to the infirmary, and as
soon as animation was restored, the governor returned
to the prisoner’s cell, and then found that
“the hammock lashing was made fast in two places
to the cross beam from the loom to the wall; in one
was a long loop, in which Major had placed his
feet; in the other a noose, as far distant from the
loop as the length of the beam would permit, in
which he had put his head; a portion of the rope
between noose and loop he had held in his hand.”
It was quite clear, therefore, that he had no determined
intention of committing suicide; besides
which he had chosen his time just as the turnkey
was about to visit him, and he had eaten his supper,
“which,” says the governor, “was no indication
of despair.” Major soon recovered, and pretended
to be sincerely ashamed of his wicked behaviour.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards a man, Combe, in the refractory
cell, tried to hang himself with a pocket handkerchief.
Placing his bedstead against the wall, he
had used it as a ladder to climb up to the grating
of the ventilator in the ceiling of his cell. To this
he had made fast the handkerchief, then dropped;
but he was found standing calmly by the bed, with
the noose not even tight. Next a woman, Catherine
Roper, tried the same trick, and was found lying
full length on the floor, and evidently she was
quite uninjured. Then came a real affair; and
from the hour at which the act was perpetrated
all doubt of intention was unhappily impossible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Lewis Abrahams, a gloomy, ill-tempered
man, was punished for breaking a fly-shuttle;
again for calling his warder a liar. That night he
hung himself. He was found quite dead and cold,
partly extended on the stone floor, and partly reclining
as it were against the cell wall. He had suspended
himself by the slight “nettles” (small
cords) of his hammock, which had broken by his
weight. The prisoner in the next cell reported that
between one and two in the morning he had heard
a noise of some one kicking against the wall; and
then no doubt the deed was done.</p>

<p>After this unhappy example attempts rapidly
multiplied, though happily none were otherwise than
feigned. One tried the iron grating and a piece of
cord; another used his cell block as a drop, but was
careful to retain the halter in his hands; a third,
Moses Josephs, tried to cut his throat, but on examination
nothing but a slight reddish scratch was
found, which the doctor was convinced was done by
the back of the knife. In all these cases immediate
and anxious attention was afforded by all the officials
of the Penitentiary. The governor himself, who
never gave himself an hour’s relaxation, and was always
close at hand, was generally the first on the
scene of suicide. If there was but a hint of anything
wrong he was ready to spend hours with the intending
<i>felo-de-se</i>. Thus in Metzer’s&mdash;a fresh
case: a man who would not eat, was idle too, morose
and sullen, “though spoken to always in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
kindest manner.” No sooner was it known that
he was brooding over the length of his confinement&mdash;his
was a life sentence&mdash;and had hinted at suicide,
than the governor spent hours with him in exhortation.
Metzer, being a weaver by trade, had
been placed in a cell furnished with a loom; from
this he was to be changed immediately to another,
lest the beam should be a temptation to him; but
the governor, being uneasy, first visited him again,
and found him, though late at night, in his clothes
perambulating his cell. On this his neighbour was
set to watch him for the rest of the night, and the
doctor gave him a composing draught. Next morning,
when they told him he was to leave his cell for
good, he became outrageously violent, and assaulted
every one around. He was now taken forcibly to the
infirmary, and put in a strait-waistcoat; whereupon
he grew calmer and promised to go to his new
cell, provided he was allowed to take his own hammock
with him. It struck the governor at once
that something might be concealed in it, and it was
searched minutely. Inside the bedclothes they
found a couple of yards of hammock lashing, one
end of which was made into a noose, “leaving,”
the governor remarks, “little doubt of his intention.”</p>

<p>But to meet and frustrate these repeated attempts
at suicide were by no means the governor’s only
trials. The misconduct of many other prisoners
must have made his life a burthen to him. Thefts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
were frequent: these fellows’ fingers itched to lay
their hands on all that came in their way. The
tower wardsman&mdash;a prisoner in a place of trust&mdash;steals
his warder’s rations; others filch knives,
metal buttons, bath brick, and food from one another.
Then there was much wasteful destruction
of materials, with idleness and carelessness at the
looms, aggravated often by the misappropriation
of time in manufacture of trumpery articles for
their own wear: one makes himself a pair of green
gaiters, another a pair of cloth shoes, a third an
imitation watch of curled hair, rolled into a ball,
which hangs in his fob by a strip of calico for
guard.</p>

<p>These were doubtless offences of a trivial character.
The anxiety evinced by many to escape from
durance was a much more serious affair. Surprising
ingenuity and unwearied patience are exhibited
by prisoners in compassing this, the great aim and
object of all who are not free. As yet, however,
the efforts made were tentative only and incomplete.
To break a hole in the wall or manufacture false
keys was the highest flight of their inventive genius,
and the plot seldom went very far. One of the first
cases was discovered quite by chance. On searching
a prisoner’s cell, some screws, a few nails, and
two pieces of thick iron wire were found concealed
in his loom; and in one of his shoes as it hung
upon the wall, a piece of lead shaped so as to correspond
with the wards of a cell key. This the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
prisoner confessed he had made with his knife from
memory, and altogether without a pattern. “I
have a very nice eye,” he said, “and I have always
carefully observed the keys as I saw them in the
officers’ hands.” “And what did you mean to do
with the key?” he was further asked. “To get
away, of course.” “How?” “I can open the
wooden door when I please, and then I should have
unlocked my gate.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> On examination a hole was
found in his door, just below the bolt and opposite
the handle; through this, by means of a narrow
piece of stuff, a knitting needle in fact, he could
move back the bolt whenever he pleased. Once out
in the ward, he meant, with a file he had also secreted,
to get through the bars of the passage window.
The wards of this key were fastened into a
wooden handle, which was also found in his cell. Another
prisoner, having been allowed to possess himself
of a large spike nail, which had been negligently
left about in the yard, worked all night at the wall
of his cell, and soon succeeded in removing several
bricks. The hole he made was large enough to
allow him passage. Besides this, from the military
great-coats, on which he was stitching during the
day, he had made himself a coat and trousers. He
might have actually got away had not a warder
visited his cell to inspect his work, and taking up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the great-coats as they lay in a heap in the corner,
discovered the disguise beneath, also the spike nail,
and the rubbish of bricks and mortar from the hole.
More adventurous still, a third prisoner proposed
to escape by stealing his warder’s keys. Failing an
opportunity, he too turned his attention to making
false ones; and for the purpose cut up with scissors
his pewter drinking can into bits. By holding the
pieces near the hot irons he used for his tailoring,
he melted the metal, and ran it into a mould of
bread. Information of this project was given by
another prisoner in time to nip it in the bud. Another,
again, had been clever enough to remove a
number of bricks, and would have passed undetected,
had not the governor by chance, when in his
cell, touched the wall and found it damp. A closer
inspection showed that the mortar around the
bricks had been picked out, and the joints filled in
by a mixture of pounded mortar and chewed bread.
On the outside was laid a coating of whiting, such
as was issued to the prisoners to help them in cleaning
their cans.</p>

<p>In some mischief of this kind, one or other of
the prisoners was perpetually engaged. Cutting up
their sheets to fabricate disguises; melting the
metal buttons, as the man just mentioned had
melted his pewter can; laying hold of files, rasps,
old nails, scissors, tin, copper wire, or whatever else
came handy; and working always with so much
secrecy and despatch, that their plans were discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
more by fortune generally, than good management.
In those days the best methods of prison
discipline were far from matured. We know now
that the surest preventives against escape, are repeated
and unexpected searchings, with continuous
vigilant supervision. A prisoner to carry out his
schemes must have leisure, and must be left to
himself to work unperceived. By the practice of
the Penitentiary, prisoners had every facility to escape;
and we shall find ere long, that they knew
how to make the most of their advantages. For the
present, all the good luck was on the side of the
gaolers.</p>

<p>But at this juncture a new trouble threatened all
the peace and comfort of the place. The prisoners
seem to have grown all at once alive to the power
they possessed of combination. It had been suspected
for some time that a conspiracy was in progress
among the denizens of D Ward, Pentagon two,
and a minute search of the several cells brought to
light a number of clandestine communications.
These, written mostly on the blank pages of prayer-books,
and spare copy-book leaves, were all to the
same effect: exhortations to riot and mutiny. A
certain George Vigers was the prime mover; all
the letters, which were very widely disseminated,
having issued from his pen. It had long been
openly discussed among the prisoners that the hulks
were pleasanter places than the Penitentiary. Here,
then, was an opportunity of removal. All who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
joined heartily in the projected commotion would
draw upon themselves the ire of the committee, and
would certainly be drafted to the hulks. To explain
what might otherwise appear unintelligible, it must
be mentioned here, that the punishment implied by
a sentence to the hulks was by no means of a terrifying
character, as is evidenced by the choice of
the prisoners.</p>

<p>A year or two later (1832), the report of the
Parliamentary Committee on Secondary Punishments
laid bare the system, and expressed their
unqualified disapprobation of the whole treatment
of convicts on board the hulks. It being accepted
that the separation of criminals, and their severe
punishment, are necessary to make crime a terror
to the evil doer, the committee pointed out that in
both these respects the system of management of
the hulks was not only necessarily deficient, but
actually inimical. All that has been said of the
miserable effects of the association of criminals in
the prisons on shore, the profaneness, the vice, the
demoralization that are its inevitable consequences,
applied in the fullest sense to the hulks. The numbers
in each ship varied from eighty to eight hundred.
The ships were divided into wards of from
twelve to thirty persons; in these they were confined
when not at labour in the dockyard, and the
evil consequences of such associations may easily
be conceived, even were the strictest discipline enforced.
But the facts are stated as follows: “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
convicts after being shut up for the night are
allowed to have lights between decks, in some
ships as late as ten o’clock; although against the
rules of the establishment, they are permitted the
use of musical instruments; flash songs, dancing,
fighting, and gaming take place; the old offenders
are in the habit of robbing the newcomers; newspapers
and improper books are clandestinely introduced;
a communication is frequently kept up with
their old associates on shore; and occasionally
spirits are introduced on board. It is true that the
greater part of these practices are against the rules
of the establishment; but their existence in defiance
of such rules shows an inherent defect in the system.
But the indulgence of purchasing tea, bread,
tobacco, etc., is allowed, the latter with a view to
the health of the prisoners; the convicts are also
allowed to receive visits from their friends, and
during the time they remain, are excused working,
sometimes for several days. Such communications
can only have the worst effect. It is an improper
indulgence to anyone in the position of a convict,
and keeps up a dangerous and improper intercourse
with old companions. The most assiduous attention
on the part of the ministers of religion would be
insufficient to stem the torrent of corruption flowing
from these various and abundant sources; and
but little attention is paid to the promotion of religious
feelings, or to the improvement of the morals
of the convicts.” It was plainly seen that the convicts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
were also allowed to earn too much money&mdash;threepence
a day to convicts in the first class, three
halfpence to those in the second; out of which the
former got sixpence a week, and the latter threepence,
to lay out in the purchase of tea, tobacco,
etc., and the remainder was laid by to be given to
them on their release. They were supposed to work
during the day at the arsenals and dockyards, but
“there was nothing in the nature or severity of
their employment which deserves the name of punishment
or hard labour.” The work lasted from
eight to ten hours, according to season; but so
much time was lost in musters, and going to and
from labour, that the summer period was never
eight hours, and winter only six and a half. As
common labourers work ten hours, and when at
task work or during harvest much longer, the convicts
could hardly be said to do more than was just
sufficient to keep them in health and exercise; indeed,
their situation could not be considered penal;
it was a state of restriction, but hardly of punishment.</p>

<p>Thus, as the committee described, the criminal
sentenced to transportation for crimes to which the
law affixed the penalty of death, passed his time,
well fed, well clothed, indulging in riotous enjoyment
by night, vexed with but moderate labour by
day. No wonder that confinement on the hulks
failed to excite a proper feeling of terror in the
minds of those likely to come under its operation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
The hulks were indeed not dreaded; prisoners described
their life in them as a “pretty jolly life.”
If any convict could but overcome the sense of
shame which the degradation of his position might
evoke, he would feel himself to be better off than
large numbers of the working-classes, who have
nothing but their daily labour to depend on for
subsistence. At the dockyards, among the free
men the situation of a convict was looked upon
with envy; and many labourers would have been
glad to change places with him, in order that they
might better their situation. It was not strange,
then, that the discontented denizens of the Penitentiary
found even the moderate rigour of that
establishment too irksome, and that they were eager
to be transferred to the hulks.</p>

<p>Towards the end of September, 1826, came the
first indications of disturbance. A prisoner having
smashed his bedstead, demolished also the iron
grating to his window, and thrust through it his
handkerchief, tied to a stick, shouting and hallooing
the while loud enough to be heard in Surrey.
The same day, Hussey, another notorious offender,
returning from confinement in the dark, was given
a pail of water to wash his cell out, but instead,
discharged the whole contents over his warder’s
head. Before he could be secured he had destroyed
everything in his cell, and had thrown the pieces
out of the window. Next, a number of prisoners
during the night took to rolling their cell-blocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and rattling their tables about. By this time the
dark cells had many occupants, who spent the night
in singing, dancing, and shouting to each other.</p>

<p>Early next morning, about 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, in this same
ward from which all the rioters came, Stephen
Harman broke everything he could lay hands on&mdash;the
window frame and all its panes of glass, his cell
table, stool, shelf, trencher, salt-box, spoon, drinking-cup,
and all his cell furniture. He had first
barricaded his door, and could not be secured till
all the mischief was done. Later in the day from
another cell came a long low whistle, followed
by the crash of broken glass. The culprit here,
when seized, confessed he had been persuaded by
others; all were to join after dinner, the whistle
being the signal to commence. The governor was
now really apprehensive, anticipating something of
a serious nature. He had a strong force of spare
warders and patrols posted in the tower of the
pentagon; but though the whistle<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> was frequently
heard during the night, nothing occurred till next
day, at half-past eight, when George Vigers and
another followed Harman’s lead and destroyed
everything in their cells. They joined their companions
in the dark cells, all of whom, being outrageously
violent, were now in handcuffs. In the dark
they continued their misconduct; using the most
shocking and revolting language to all officials who
approached them; assaulting them, deluging them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
with dirty water, resolutely refusing to give up
their beds, and breaking locks, door panels, and
windows, and this although they were restrained
in irons. These handcuffs having failed to produce
any salutary effect, they were now removed; although
several of the prisoners did not wait for
that, and had riddled themselves of their bracelets.
For the next few days “the Dark,” as these underground
cells were styled in official language, continued
to be the scene of the most unseemly uproar.
When Archdeacon Potts, one of the committee,
visited it he was received with hoots and
yells; and this noise was kept up incessantly day
and night. But at length, after nearly a fortnight
of close confinement, the strength of the rioters
broke down, several of them being removed to the
hospital, while the others went back to their cells.
But there was no lack of reinforcements: fresh
offenders took up the game, and the dark cells were
continually full. As soon as those first punished
were sufficiently recovered, they broke out again.
The cases of misconduct, generally of the same description,
were varied now and then by a plot to
break the water-mill by whirling round the cranks
too fast, continuous noise, insolence, dancing definitely
the double shuffle, attempts to incite a whole
ward, when in the corridor at school, to rise against
their warders, overpower them, and take possession
of their keys.</p>

<p>Throughout the long nights of the dreary winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
months these disturbances continued; a time of
the utmost anxiety and annoyance to worthy Captain
Chapman, who was invariably the foremost in
the fray. Nothing can exceed the pluck and energy
with which he tackled the most truculent. When
a prisoner, mad with rage, dares any man to enter
his cell, it is Governor Chapman who always enters
without a moment’s hesitation; when another,
armed with a sleeveboard, threatens to dash out
everybody’s brains, it is Captain Chapman who secures
the weapon of offence; when a body of prisoners
on the mill break out into open mutiny, and
the warder in charge is in terror for his personal
safety, it is Governor Chapman who repairs at
once to the spot and collars the ringleaders. Perhaps
it would have been better if so much resolute
courage had not been tempered with too much kindness
of heart. No one can read of Captain Chapman’s
proceedings without admitting that he was
brave; but for his particular duties he was undoubtedly
also amiable to a fault. Had he been more unrelenting
it is probable that the worst offenders
would never have gone such lengths in their insubordination.
A word or two of contrition, often
the merest sham, was sufficient generally to secure
his pardon. Thus when a man has worked himself
into a fury and appears ready for any act of desperation,
the mere appearance of the governor
calms him, and the prisoner, softened, says, “You,
sir, use me much better than I deserve. Put me in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the dark.” “I left him,” says Captain Chapman,
on one occasion, “saying I trusted my lenity would
have a much better effect than a dark cell. I therefore
admonished and pardoned him.” Had such
kindness been productive of good results no one
could have questioned his wisdom; almost invariably
it was worse than futile, and the malcontents
soon worse than ever, and devising fresh schemes.</p>

<p>It was in this winter that the superintending
committee became convinced that the methods of
coercion they possessed were hardly so stringent
as the case required. They reported to the House
of Commons that “there were among the prisoners
some profligate and turbulent characters for whose
outrageous conduct the punishments in use under
the rules and regulations of the Penitentiary were
by no means sufficient.” They found by experience
that “confinement in a dark cell, though in most
cases a severe and efficacious punishment, operates
very differently on different persons. It appears
to lose much of its effect from repetition; it cannot
always be carried far without the danger of
injuring health; and on some men as well as boys
it has no effect.” Many of the ringleaders in the
disturbances just described were subjected to
twenty-five, twenty-eight, and even to thirty days
of uninterrupted imprisonment in the dark, and
certainly with little effect. In view of this want
of some more salutary punishment the committee
expressed a wish for power to flog. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
convinced that “the framers of the statute under
which the Penitentiary is now governed acted erroneously
in omitting the power to inflict corporal
punishment when they re-enacted most of the other
provisions of the 19th Geo. III. And they are satisfied
that a revival of this power (a power possessed
in every other criminal prison in this country)
would be highly advantageous to the management
of this prison, provided such power were
accompanied by regulations adequate to control the
exercise of it, and to guard against its being
abused.”</p>

<p>Soon after these lines were in print, and presented
to the House, it became more than ever apparent
that to tame these turbulent characters some serious
steps must be taken soon. During the early months
of 1827 there had been no cessation of misconduct
of the kind already described, but the cases were
mostly isolated, and generally succumbed to treatment.
But as March began a storm gathered which
soon burst like a whirlwind on the place. It was
heralded by a riot in chapel on Sunday, the 3rd of
March. Previous to the sermon, during evening
service, a rumbling noise was heard, as if the prisoners
assembled were stamping in unison with their
feet. The sound ceased with the singing of the
psalm, and recommenced during the sermon, and
increased in violence. It was discovered that the
noise was made by the prisoners knocking with their
fists against the sheet iron that separated the several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
divisions. As the uproar continued to increase to
a shameful and alarming extent, the governor left
the chapel to fetch the patrols, and other spare
officers, all of whom, with drawn cutlasses, were
posted near the chapel door. The prisoners were
then removed to their cells, and, in the presence
of this exhibition of force, they went quietly enough.
The ringleaders were afterwards singled out and
punished: the chief among them being a monitor,
long remarkable for his piety, who on this occasion
had distinguished himself by mimicking the chaplain,
by commenting in scandalous terms upon the
sermons, and using slang expressions instead of
responses.</p>

<p>After this, in all parts of the prison there are
strong symptoms of mutiny. Loud shouts, laughter,
and the thieves’ whistle on every side. For the next
few days there is much uneasiness; and at length,
about midnight on the 8th, the governor is roused
from his bed. Pentagon six is in an uproar. As
Captain Chapman hurries to the scene he is saluted
with the crash of glass, interspersed with loud cries
of triumph and of encouragement. The airing-yard
below is strewed with fragments; broken window-frames,
fragments of glass, utensils, and tables
smashed to bits. Two notorious offenders in B
Ward, Hawkins and John Caswell, are busy at the
work of destruction, and already everything is in
ruins. The tumult is so tremendous, so many others
contribute their shouts, and the thieves’ whistle runs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
so quickly from cell to cell, that sleep is impossible
to any one within the boundary wall; and presently
all officials, chaplain, doctor, manufacturers, and
steward, have joined the governor, and are helping
to quell the disturbance. It is quelled, but hardly
has the governor got back to bed, at two in the
morning, when the uproar recommences: the same
noise and loud shouts from one side of the pentagons
of prisoners, inciting each other to continue
the riot. Next day, from various other wards come
reports that a spirit of insubordination is on the increase;
and the offenders in the dark, ten in number,
are violent in the extreme. Again, at midnight,
the governor is aroused by a tremendous
yelling from Pentagon six, followed by the smashing
of glass. The offenders are seized at once,
and, the governor remarks, “from what I could
learn, were pretty roughly handled by their captors.”
During this night, too, in noise and violence
the several prisoners in the dark exceeded, if possible,
their accustomed mutinous conduct. One, by
some extraordinary effort, broke the part of his
door to which the lock was attached, and got it into
his cell, swearing he would brain the first person
who approached him. There was much answering
to and from the dark cells and the upper stories of
the pentagons opposite. There was evidently discontent
also in other parts of the prison. Those
prisoners who had no hope of gaining any remission
of their sentences, having no inducement to behave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
well, were on the point of insurrection. In
addition to these alarms, on the night of the 14th it
was reported to the governor that the prisoners were
making their escape from the dark cells. The noise
was so tremendous that it could be heard all over
the prison.</p>

<p>And now mysterious documents emanating from
the prisoners were picked up, containing complaints
mostly of the treatment they received, and full of
terrible threats. As time passed, the worst of these
threats found vent in the hanging of the infirmary
warder’s cat. The halter was a strip of round towel
from behind the door, and a piece of paper was
affixed to it, with these portentous words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq8 p1">“you see yor Cat is hung And<br />
you Have Been the corse of it<br />
for yoor Bad Bavior to Those<br />
arond you. Dom yor eis, yoo’l<br />
get pade in yor torn yet.”</p>

<p class="p1">Next were several closely written sheets, full of
inflammatory matter, which gave the authorities
so much uneasiness that several hundred prisoners
were closely examined as to their contents. As
these letters afford curious evidence of the importance
prisoners arrogate to themselves, it may be interesting
to publish one <i>in extenso</i>. It was found
on the road back from chapel. There was no signature
attached. It was addressed to the visitor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Four instances of brutality have occurred
in this Establishment within the last week;
the which we, as men (if we do our duty towards
God and man), cannot let escape our notice, and
hope and trust you will not let them pass without
taking them into your serious consideration. We
will take the liberty of putting a few questions to
you, which we hope you will not be offended at.
Who gave Mr. Bulmer authority to strike a lad
named Quick almost sufficient to have broken his
arm, indeed so bad that the lad could not lift his
hand to his head? and who gave Mr. Pilling the
same authority to smite a lad to the ground, named
Caswell, with a ruler, the same as a butcher would
a Bullock, without him (Caswell) making the least
resistance? On Saturday night last there was brutal
and outrageous doings, Mr. Pilling as desperate as
ever, assisted by that villain Turner (we cannot give
him a better term&mdash;we wish we could). Who
would have thought a man could have been so cruel
as to lift a poker against a fellow-creature? A
ruler, we have heard, was broken into two pieces,
a thing that is made of the hardest of wood. Was
there ever, in the annals of treachery and oppression,
facts more scandalous than these! No. To
hear their cries was sufficient to make the blood run
cold of any man, if he was possessed of the least
animal feeling (‘For God’s sake have compassion,
and do not quite kill me,’ etc., etc.). And we do not
hesitate to say, had not the wise Creator, that sees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and hears all, put it into the heart of a man to be
there and stop them in their bloody actions, homicide
would have been committed: then God knows
what would have been the result. We will admit
that these men committed themselves in the most
provoking manner; but still, who are, what are
these men, that they should take the law in their
own hands? You are the person they should have
applied to, and we are satisfied you would not
have given them such authority. Many men have
committed as bad, or worse crimes than either of
these, and in less than one minute afterwards have
been sorry for it. How did these men know but
this was the case here? but without speaking to
them, as Christians would do, knocks them down,
as we have stated before, as a Butcher would do
an Ox&mdash;we cannot make a better comparison&mdash;Messrs.
Pilling and Turner in particular. The governor,
too, who professes to fear God, we think if
he would study the great and principal commandment,
that is, to do to others as he would be done
unto, it would be much more to his credit; especially,
sir, as you and other gentlemen of this establishment
expect when there is a discharge of prisoners
(and it is to be hoped that soon will be the
case) that they will give the establishment a good
name. They cannot do it, unless there is a stop put
to such brutal actions; they will most likely speak
the sentiments of their hearts; they will say they
have seen some of their fellow-creatures driven like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
wrecks before the rough tide of power till there was
no hold left to save them from destruction. That
will be a pretty thing for the public to hear. And,
sir, we do not wish to be too severe, but unless Pilling
and Turner are dismissed from the Establishment,
and that shortly, we will fight as long as there
is a drop of blood in us; for it is evident, many men
have expired from a much lighter blow than either
of those delivered; therefore necessity obliges us&mdash;we
must do it for our own safety; but depend upon
it, sir, it is far from our wish to do anything of the
kind, for your sake, and for the sake of what few
good ones we have (and God knows it is but few).
There is 3 good men in the Pentagon&mdash;Messrs.
Newstead, Rutter, and Hall, and we wish we could
speak well of the others&mdash;but we cannot.</p>

<p class="p2">“N.B. We do not wish to give the last new
warder a bad name, for we have not seen sufficient
of him to speak either way, but what little we have
seen leads us to believe he is a good man. We hope,
sir, you will excuse us, but we will ask you another
question. If you were in Mr. Pilling’s situation,
and a man committed himself, would you not reason
with him on the base impropriety of what he had
done? We know you would. Instead of that, Mr.
Pilling takes a delight in aggravating the cause with
a grin, or a jeer of contempt, not only before you
see him (the prisoner), afterwards the same;
which, without the least doubt, makes a man commit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
acts of violence which at other times he would
tremble at the idea. We hope, sir, you will take
this into your worthy and serious consideration, and
by so doing you will greatly oblige,</p>

<p class="pr6">“Your Obedient Humble Servants,</p>
<p class="pr2">“<span class="smcap">Friends to the Oppressed</span>.”</p>

<p class="p2">This letter indicates the prisoners’ attitude. On
another occasion a few of them go to the governor’s
office to remonstrate with him on one of his punishments.
We might as well imagine&mdash;to compare
great things with small&mdash;a deputation from the
criminal classes waiting on a judge to complain of
his sentence on a thief. As soon as the protesters
are ushered in, one says that Davis, the culprit, is
very sorry for what he has done; another says
that he was unwell at the time, and all unite in hoping
the governor will let him off. Fortunately the
governor is not so weak as they fancied. He says:
“On my remarking to them&mdash;which I did with
much indignation&mdash;their highly improper conduct
in presuming to remonstrate with me in the execution
of my duty, Boak (one of the three) remarked,
that by their rules they were to apply to the governor
or visitor if they had any complaint. To
which I answered, ‘Most certainly,’ but that my
confining Timothy Davis could not possibly be any
grievance to them; and repeated that their presuming
to dictate to me was of such a reprehensible and
insubordinate nature that I should confine them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the dark cells.” But as they were penitent, and
promised for the future to mind their own business,
they were released the same day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the rioting and destruction proceeded
without intermission. A frequent device now was
for prisoners to barricade their cell doors, so as to
work the more uninterruptedly. For this purpose
the cell-blocks or some of the fragments from the
demolished furniture served; and, as a brilliant
idea, one or two prisoners invented the practice of
filling their keyholes with sand and brick rubbish,
or hampering the locks with their knives. But in
March the riot exceeded anything in previous experience.
It was prefaced by the usual exhibitions
of defiance and insubordinate conduct, and the uproar
as before broke out in the middle of the night.
A dozen or more of the prisoners dressed themselves,
barricaded their doors, and then set to work.
By and by the whole ward was in a tumult. The
dark cells were already full, and there was no other
place of punishment. The shouting and yelling
could not therefore be checked, and continuing far
into the day excited other prisoners at exercise, so
that they were on the point of laying violent hands
upon their warders. One scoundrel took off his
cap and tried to cheer on his fellows to acts of
violence; and some followed the warder into a
corner, swearing they would have his life. The
condition of the whole prison was now so alarming
that the governor, with permission of the visitor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
sought extraneous help. Application was
made to the Queen’s Square police office for a force
of constables to assist in maintaining order and insuring
the safe custody of the prisoners. As soon
as these reinforcements arrived they were marched
to the airing-yard of Pentagon five&mdash;the scene of
the recent riots.</p>

<p>Here a large body of prisoners were at exercise.
The governor and the visitor in turn addressed
them, pointing out “the shame and disrepute they
were bringing on themselves and the institution by
their mutinous conduct.” Several in reply were
most insolent in speech and manner, declaring they
did not deserve to be treated with suspicion. One
addressed a warder close at hand with loud abuse,
another the taskmaster, swearing he was starved
to death, and both had to be removed. These constables
remained on duty during the night, and for
several weeks to come continued to give their assistance.
On the return of the prisoners to their wards,
the governor spent four hours, from seven to eleven
o’clock, going patiently from cell to cell, impressing
on each man the necessity for orderly and subordinate
conduct. “My time and efforts,” he says
next day, “were, I regret to say, quite thrown
away, for the noise and shouting continued during
the night, though not quite to the same extent.”
Nothing very serious, however, happened till three
o’clock the following day, when Hickman, a prisoner
in the infirmary, began to break his windows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and with loud huzzahs endeavoured to incite the
others in the yards to “acts of violence and insubordination.”
He was answered by many voices,
and the tumult soon became general. Meanwhile,
the governor and the visitor had repaired to Hickman’s
cell as soon as the smashing of glass was
heard, but the man had cunningly made fast his
door, and could not be interfered with. It appeared
that he had complained of want of exercise, and had
accompanied this complaint with so much contrition
for previous violent conduct, that the surgeon had
allowed his cell door to be unlocked, so that he
might walk when he liked in the passage. Directly
the officers had gone to dinner he got out, and,
using his knife, which had imprudently been left in
his possession, hampered the locks at both ends of
the passage. His next act was to slice into ribbons
the whole of his bedding and that of several cells
adjoining his own, which were unoccupied and
proved not to be locked. This business satisfactorily
arranged, he began to shout and to smash all the
windows within his reach. Before he could be secured
he had demolished eighty-two panes of glass
and several sashes complete. He was found brandishing
his broom, and offering to fight the lot of
his captors, one of whom promptly knocked him
down, when he was quickly handcuffed and carried
back to his cell. But the noise he made that night,
with others, was so great that the governor declared
he never closed his eyes during the night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Night after night the misconduct of the prisoners
continued, and grew worse and worse. Wards
hitherto well behaved became infected. In C Ward,
Pentagon six, “they commenced at 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> shouting
and bellowing like the rest.” The visitor on going
to “the dark” was again most grossly insulted and
abused. Another evening the noise and shouting
that broke out was so loud that many officers going
off duty heard the disturbance at the other end of
Vauxhall Bridge, and returned to the prison.</p>

<p>All through the months of April and May the
violence of the malcontents continued unabated.
They had found out their strength, no doubt, and
laughed at all attempts to coerce them. Neither
dark cells nor irons exercised the least effect, and
the only remaining punishment&mdash;the lash, the
committee were not as yet empowered to enforce.
It must be confessed that one reads with regret that
a parcel of unruly scoundrels should thus be allowed
to make a mockery of the punishment to which they
were sentenced by the law, and that they should
be suffered unchecked to set all order and discipline
at defiance. And all this deliberate insolence and
open insubordination could have but one end, and
culminated at length in a murderous affray, in
which a couple of prisoners fell upon the machine-keeper
and nearly killed him. The plot had been
well laid, and brewing for some time. About seven
o’clock one morning, while working quietly at the
crank, prisoner Salmon rushed at Mr. Mullard, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
machine-keeper, and knocked him off the platform
by a tremendous blow, which caught him just behind
the ear, and cut his head open. Crouch, another
prisoner, struck Mr. Mullard at the same
moment. When on the ground he was kicked by
Salmon in the mouth. No one but the wardsman,
another prisoner, came to poor Mullard’s assistance;
but this man acted with great spirit, and it was
mainly owing to his prompt interference that the
machine-keeper escaped with his life.</p>

<p>At the moment the attack was made all the other
officers were at a distance. One warder said he
saw Mr. Mullard fall, but thought it was accidental,
and that the prisoner Salmon had stooped over to
pick him up. However, when the other prisoners
crowded round, shouting, “Give it him! Give it
him! Lay on,” this warder, perceiving their evil
intentions, took to his heels&mdash;to get assistance,
for he afterwards indignantly disclaimed all idea
of quitting the yard through personal apprehension.
At the tower he found the taskmaster coming out
cutlass in hand; Rogan, the warder, got one also,
and both hurried back to the yard. Smith, the
wardsman, was fighting with Crouch, and Mr. Mullard,
who had got again to his feet, with Salmon;
the other prisoners looking on, being, as they
afterwards asserted, afraid to stir, “particularly
after seeing the warder, Rogan, run away.” Crouch
now came at the taskmaster “with fury in his
looks;” upon which the latter drew his cutlass and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
warned him to stand off, and then both Crouch and
Salmon were secured. There was no doubt the
greater part of the prisoners were concerned in this
mutiny, for although Mullard called aloud for assistance,
not a soul but Smith, the wardsman, stirred
a finger to help him. These miscreants were subsequently
tried at the Old Bailey, and sentenced to
increased imprisonment.</p>

<p>Not long after this the new Act, authorizing
the committee to flog for aggravated misconduct,
was passed, and then a clearance was made of the
worst subjects by sending them from the Penitentiary
to the hulks. This was really yielding to the
prisoners. But it gained a certain lull of peace
within the walls&mdash;no slight boon after the disturbances,
and it was hoped that the new powers of
punishment would check any further outbreak
amongst those who remained.</p>

<h3>SERIOUS DISTURBANCES</h3>

<p class="pch">Irregularities continued&mdash;Intrigues between male and female
prisoners&mdash;Women conspire to be removed&mdash;Their unceasing
misconduct&mdash;Plot to murder the Matron&mdash;Renewed
trials of Governor&mdash;A number of suicides&mdash;A serious
assault&mdash;First flogging under new Act&mdash;One hundred
and fifty lashes inflicted&mdash;An effectual warning&mdash;Assaults
checked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Irregularities</span> of an entirely new character appeared
at Millbank after the exodus of the worst-behaved
had taken place. An intrigue was discovered
to have been in progress for many months, between
the women in the laundry and certain of the
male prisoners. This had not gone further than the
interchange of correspondence, but its existence is
in some respects a proof of the laxity of the discipline
maintained in the Penitentiary. It was customary
to make up the clothes of the male prisoners
sent to the wash in kits, or small parcels, which
were opened in the laundry by a female prisoner,
called the “kitter.” One day the kitter, by name
Margaret Woods, found among the clothes a slip
of paper&mdash;a prayer-book leaf&mdash;on which some
man had written that he came from Glasgow, and
that he hoped the women were all well. Woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
not being able to read, showed it to another
woman, who showed it to a third, a Scotch girl,
Ann Kinnear, who came also from Glasgow.
“Yes,” she said, “I know him well. It’s John
Davidson&mdash;a very nice young man; and if you
won’t answer it, I’ll write myself.” The acquaintance,
on paper, soon deepened between Kinnear
and Davidson. One of her tributes of affection
was a heart, which she worked with gray worsted
on a flannel bandage belonging to Davidson. At
another time she sent him a lock of her hair.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand the flutter throughout the
laundry caused by this flirtation, which was known
and talked of by all the women. They were all
eager to have correspondents, having husbands
“outside” being no obstacle seemingly; nor was
age, for an old woman, with grown-up children, entered
herself as eagerly as the girls barely in their
teens. John Davidson was in all cases the channel
of communication. He promised to do his best for
each of his correspondents: to find out a nice
sweetheart for Mary Ann Thacker, and to tell
Elizabeth Trenery how fared her friend Combs,
with whom she had travelled up from Cornwall.
He expressed his regret to his own friend Kinnear,
that he was likely soon to be set at large; but that
before going he would “turn her over” to another
nice young man, in every way similar to himself.
How long this clandestine intercommunication
might have continued, it would be difficult to say;
but at length the wardswoman came to know of it,
and she instantly reported it to the matron. One
fine morning the whole of the kits were detained,
and a general search made in the tower. Several
letters were discovered. They were written mostly
with blue ink made of the blue-stone used for washing,
and contained any quantity of rubbish: questions,
answers, gossips, vows of unalterable affection,
promises to meet “outside” and continue
their acquaintance.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="cap1"><i>Millbank Penitentiary</i></p>
        <p class="cap2">The name of Jeremy Bentham is forever associated with
Millbank Penitentiary. In his plans for its erection nearly
a century ago he anticipated exactly the modern methods of
to-day. During the time that Millbank was used as a prison,
nearly a century, among the inmates were many notorious
rogues and criminals. As a reformatory it was not a success,
but the expensive experiment served as a lesson to the government
and it paved the way for the model prison of to-day.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>All this of itself was harmless enough, the reader
may say: and such it would have been undoubtedly
in a boys’ school next door to some seminary for
young ladies, in the suburbs; but it was hardly
in accordance with the condition of prisoners, or
the seclusion that was a part of their punishment.
And no sooner was this intrigue detected, and put
an end to, than another of similar character was
discovered between the male convicts in the kitchen
and certain maid-servants kept by the superior officers.
The steward on searching the kitchen
drawer of his housemaid&mdash;it does not appear what
led him to ransack the hiding-places of his servants’
hall&mdash;found a letter addressed to the girl by the
prisoner named Brown. Brown, when taxed with
it, admitted the letter, but declared that the first
overtures had come from the maid. He had been
cleaning the steward’s door-bell, when this forward
young person nodded to him from the passage, and
he nodded back. At the same time another prisoner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
was caught at the same game with the female
servant of the resident surgeon. On searching the
prisoner-cooks a letter from the girl was found in
this man’s pocket, and a lock of long hair, neatly
plaited. The first-mentioned girl had not confined
her smiles to Brown, for in her possession was another
letter from John Ratcliffe, a prisoner who had
been working in the starching yard close by the
steward’s quarters. Betsy S., the surgeon’s second
maid, had become also the object of the affections of
a prisoner named Roberts, who had thrown a letter
to her through the open window. But Betsy would
not encourage his advances, and took the letter at
once to her master. Moreover the chaplain’s maid
was always at her kitchen window, making signs.</p>

<p>The chief lesson to be learned from these nefarious
practices is, that it is a grave error to permit officers
and their families to reside within the walls of a
prison. In the old constructions the “gaoler’s”
house was always placed in the very centre of the
buildings, from whence he was supposed to keep a
watchful eye on all around. But the gain was only
imaginary; and even if there had been any advantage
it would have been more than nullified by the
introduction of the family, or unprofessional element,
within the walls. A prison should be like a
fortress in a state of siege: officers on duty, guards
posted, sentries always on the alert, every one everywhere
ready to meet any difficulty or danger that
may arise. No “free” person should pass the gates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
but officials actually on duty inside. In this way
the modern practice of placing all residences and
private quarters in close proximity to, but outside,
the prison is a distinct improvement on the old. By
it the moral presence of the supreme authority with
his staff is still maintained, and no such irregularities
as those I have just described could possibly
occur.</p>

<p>So far I have made but little reference to the
female convicts. Indeed, during the first years after
the reopening of the Penitentiary, except in isolated
cases, they appear to have conducted themselves
quietly enough. But the contagion from the male
pentagons could not but spread, sooner or later.
The news of the removal of the worst men to the
hulks no doubt acted as a direct incitement to misconduct.
Had not this power of removal been accompanied,
in the case of the males, with authority
to inflict corporal punishment, we should have seen
a great and continuous increase of the riotous disturbances
described already. A certain number, it
is true, had gained their ends; but if those who
remained were ambitious to tread the same path, it
was possible that sound flogging would be tried
before removal to the hulks. With the women it
was different&mdash;they could not be flogged, so they
had it much their own way. It was the same then
as now: the means of coercion to be employed
against females are limited in the extreme, and a
really bad woman can never be tamed, though she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
may in time wear herself out by her violence. We
shall see more than one instance of the seemingly
indomitable obstinacy and perversity of the female
character, when all barriers are down and only vileness
and depravity remains.</p>

<p>Long before the women broke out into open defiance
of authority there were more than rumours
that all was not right in the women’s pentagon. “Irregularities
are on the increase there,” observes the
governor in his journal. The object of the agitation
was no secret. The women wanted to get
away from the Penitentiary as the men had done.
One having abused a matron in the most insolent
terms, swore, if not sent at once to the hulks, or
abroad, she would have some one’s life. Another
sent for the governor, saying she had something
particular to confide to him. “Well?” asked Captain
Chapman. “You must send me to the hulks or
to New South Wales,” she answered. Other
women made the same request, pleading that they
had not a friend on earth, and when released they
must return to their old vicious courses. “I told
them,” says the governor, “they could only be sent
to the hulks when they were incorrigible, and to
qualify for that they must pass months in the dark.
Then I exhorted them to return to their work and
better thoughts.” But they both at once flatly refused
either to work or to think better of it, demanding
to be sent immediately to the dark, a wish
which was gratified without further delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>It now appeared evident that the discipline of the
female side was most unsatisfactory, and there had
been great remissness on the part of the officers.
It was discovered, too, among other things, that
the religious exercises had been greatly neglected:
the reading of the lesson in the morning service in
the wards had been “either shamefully slurred
over, or neglected altogether.” For this, and other
omissions, the visitor assembled the matrons in a
body, and lectured them in plain terms.</p>

<p>That very afternoon occurred the first real outbreak.
All at once the whole of one of the wards
was found to be in an uproar. The shouts and yells
of the women could be heard all over the prison,
and for a great distance beyond. The disturbance
arose in this wise: there had been great misconduct
that morning in chapel, but the offenders had
eluded detection, as they thought; therefore when
the matron reprimanded them, they concluded that
one of their number had “rounded” or “put them
away,”&mdash;in other words, had turned informer.
Elizabeth Wheatley was suspected, and upon her
the whole of her companions fell, tooth and nail,
when let out for exercise. It was with the utmost
difficulty she was rescued from their clutches. Then
the ringleaders, having been again confined to their
cells, commenced a hideous din and continued it for
hours.</p>

<p>Soon after this a violent attack is made upon the
chief matron: a woman assaults her, and deals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
her a blow that makes her nose bleed. This is the
signal for a general disturbance. All the ward join
in the uproar: those not under lock and key crowd
round the matron with frightful yells and imprecations,
and from those in their cells, come shouts
through the bars, such as “Give it her! give it her.
I’d make a matron of her, if I was out. I’d have
her life.” The unfortunate officer is only saved
from serious injury by the prompt interposition of
the wardswoman, a well-conducted prisoner; the
excitement now becomes tremendous.</p>

<p>Let us look at a scene enacted in another part
of the prison on that very same evening. It is
towards dusk in the “Long Room,” where there are
beds for nearly forty. Half a dozen women, unattended
by a turnkey, are discussing the topics of
the day. One, Nihill, is lamenting in bitter terms
the want of pluck exhibited by the others. None
of the women were “game,” she said. She was
ready to do anything, but none of the others would
give her a helping hand. There were men in the
prison, too, who were willing and able to join in a
mutiny if they only got a lead. It might be done in
chapel, where the whole of the population of the
Penitentiary collected together twice a day for
prayers. At this moment comes a new arrival,
bearing the news of the murderous assault upon the
matron, to which reference has been already made.</p>

<p>“How many were in it?” Nihill asks, she being
the leading malcontent of those mentioned above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Five.”</p>

<p>“That’s three too many. I wish I’d been there.
Wait till I get my green jacket,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I’ll carry a knife,
and I’ll stick it into her.”</p>

<p>“She’s a brute,” adds another. “I’d serve her
so too.”</p>

<p>Here a woman interposed on the other side and a
fierce quarrel ensued and there was a hand to hand
fight. The other prisoners gave the alarm; assistance
arrived; and the combatants were secured and carried
off to the dark cells.</p>

<p>The next affair occurred at school time. A prisoner,
Smith, was checked by the matron for quarrelling
with the monitress, whereupon Smith, seizing
her stool, swore she would make away with the
matron. Two other prisoners came to the rescue,
and, pushing the matron into a cell close by, got in
with her, and pulled the door to. Smith in a fury
raced after them, but the cell gate was locked before
she arrived, and she had to be satisfied with
the grossest abuse from the further side. But Sara
Smith was now mistress of the ward, and ranged
up and down with uplifted stool, and fury in her
looks, till the governor, bold Captain Chapman,
came to the spot with his patrols, and she was, with
some difficulty, overpowered.</p>

<p>So determined were the women to misconduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
themselves, that they took in bad part the advice
of the few who were well-disposed. When one
Mary Anne Titchborne begged her companions to
behave better, they turned at her <i>en masse</i>, pursuing
her to her cell with horrid threats, brandishing their
pattens over their heads, and swearing they would
have her life. The following feminine feat at first
sight appeared most extraordinary. One of the
female prisoners, it was declared, had in the night
jumped out of her window, on the second floor, into
the airing-yard below, a height of seventeen feet;
and the governor, who visited her about 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, four
hours after the accident, found her sitting in her
cell again, quietly at work, and “with the exception
of a sprain, or a contusion of the fingers of
the right hand, quite unhurt.” According to this
woman’s story, she determined to take her life about
ten o’clock and threw herself out of her window.
“It seems incredible,” remarks Captain Chapman,
“that she could have effected this, as the sash of
the window opens from the bottom with the hinge,
forming thus an acute angle&mdash;in fact a V&mdash;having
an aperture about ten inches wide. Not a single
pane of glass was broken, and Miller, for all her
fall, was unhurt, beyond a scratch or two upon her
fingers.” Miller when questioned further stated
that on reaching <i>terra firma</i> she was at first quite
stunned. By and by she got up and walked about
the yard for several hours; then, finding it cold,
she returned to her ward, which she accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
easily, as all the external doors and passage gates
had been left unlocked. This carelessness with reference
to “security” locks, as they are called, or
the gates that interpose between the prisoners and
fresh air, might easily make the hair of a modern
gaoler stand on end; and even the considerate Governor
Chapman was forced to reprimand the matrons
for this gross neglect of duty. A little later
Miller confessed her fraud. After school at night,
she had managed to secrete herself in an unoccupied
cell. No one missed her; and about eleven,
coming out, she commenced to wander up and down
the ward, going from cell to cell knocking.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“Miller.”</p>

<p>“Where have you come from?”</p>

<p>“I have jumped out of the window, and got back
through the gates, which were left open.”</p>

<p>“Go back to your cell, for goodness’ sake.”</p>

<p>“I can’t get in, the door is locked.”</p>

<p>“Call up the matron then.”</p>

<p>“I daren’t.”</p>

<p>Such was the conversation overheard by others.
About three o’clock, Miller could stand it no longer,
and woke the matron of the ward.</p>

<p>One other case of misconduct among the females
which occurred some months afterward may be mentioned
here. This was the discovery of a conspiracy
which at first sight seemed of rather serious dimensions.
Its apparent object was to murder the chaplain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the matron, and a female officer named Bateman,
all of whom had incurred the rancour of
certain of the worst prisoners. One day in chapel
an officer noticed much nudging and winking between
two or three of the women, one of whom
afterwards came up to her, as she stood by the altar
rails, and said, “There’s a conspiracy going on.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked the matron.</p>

<p>“In a bag.”</p>

<p>“A bag? Who’s got it?”</p>

<p>“Jones.”</p>

<p>And in effect, upon Jones was found a bag of
white linen, six inches by four, and inside it a strip
of bright yellow serge, such as the “first class”
women wore. On this yellow ground was worked
in black letters, as a sampler might be, the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Stab balling (bawling) Bateman, dam matron
too, and parson; no justis now, may they brile in
hell and their favrits too. God bless the governor;
but this makes us devils. Shan’t care what we do&mdash;20
of us sworn to drink and theve in spite&mdash;get
a place&mdash;rob and bolt. Make others pay for this.
Shan’t fear any prison or hel after this. Can’t
suffer more. Some of us meen to gulp the sakrimint,
good blind: they swear they’ll burk the matron
when they get out, and throw her in the river.
No justis. Destroy this. No fear. All swer to
die; but don’t split, be firm, stic to yor othe, and
all of ye, stab them all. Watch yor time&mdash;stab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
am to the hart in chaple; get round them and they
can’t tell who we mean to stab.”</p>

<p>This bag was akin somewhat to the mysterious
<i>chuppaties</i>, which were the forerunner of the Indian
Mutiny. It was passed from hand to hand, each
prisoner opening, reading, and then sending it on.
Jones, on whom it was found, declared she had
picked it up in the passage. She was lame, and
returning from exercise had put her crutch on something
soft. “Why, here is some one’s swag,” she
cried, and thereupon became possessed of it. But
she had intended to give it up to the matron; “Oh
yes, directly she had read it.” However, another
prisoner forestalled her, and Jones got into trouble.
Then, with the instinct of self-preservation, which
is stronger, perhaps, among prisoners than in other
human beings, Jones “rounded” at once, in other
words, gave full information of the plot. Hatred
of the matron was at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>This great conspiracy was of a piece with many
such plots in modern experience&mdash;mere empty
threats and rank bombastic talk. Prisoners are
very fond of bragging what they mean to do, both
inside and outside when again free. In the present
case there was supposed to be much more in store
for the matron than the actual assault with which
they threatened her. One of the conspirators swore
that if she (the matron) escaped now, later on vengeance
should overtake her. “As soon as I’m free
I’ll do for that cat of destruction. I’ll send her first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a dead dog with a rope round its neck, made up
into a parcel. That’ll frighten her. Curse her, I’ll
give her a bitter pill yet. If it’s ten years hence,
I’ll never forget her. I’ll watch her, and track her
outside; and I have friends of the right sort that’ll
help me.” But threatened men and women live
long, and nothing much happened to the matron
then or afterwards.</p>

<p>Let us now return to the male side. Here the
worries and annoyances of the governor were still
varied and continuous. Hardly had misconduct in
one shape succumbed to treatment, than it broke
out in another. Many attempts to escape&mdash;one
of which, to be detailed hereafter, went very near
complete success; a couple of very serious assaults,
and a fresh suicidal epidemic, still kept his energies
on the stretch. It was his practice, as we know,
to give his immediate attention to anything and
everything, as soon as it occurred; and although
he must now have been alive to the preponderance
of imposture in the attempts prisoners made upon
their own lives, still so kindhearted a man could
not but be greatly exercised in spirit, whenever the
suicides seemed of a <i>bonâ fide</i> nature.</p>

<p>The following case called at once for his most
anxious interference. One Thomas Edwards was
reported to have it in contemplation to do himself
a mischief. Another prisoner detected him in the
act of concealing a piece of hammock lashing in
his bosom, gave information, and the halter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
seized at once by the officer in charge. It was found
to be nearly two yards in length. In Edwards’
pocket was also a letter, an old letter from his
brother, across which in red chalk was written:</p>

<p class="p2">“To Captain Chapman. The last request of an
innocent, and injured man is, that this note may
be delivered to a much loved brother.</p>

<p>“I can no longer bear my unfortunate situation.
Death will be a relief to me, though I fain would
have seen you once more; but I was fearful it
might heighten your grief. The privations of cold
and hunger, I can no more suffer. I now bid you
an eternal farewell. God forgive me for the rash
act I am about to commit&mdash;the hour is fast approaching
when I must leave this troublesome
world. Write to my dear sister, but never let her
know the truth of my end, and comfort her as well
as you can. God forgive me.</p>

<p class="pr6">Farewell for ever,</p>
<p class="pr2">Farewell.”</p>

<p class="p2">“I immediately sent for Edwards,” says Captain
Chapman in his journal. “He appeared much distressed.
The tears rolled down his cheeks, but he
would not speak. I said everything I could think
of to soothe and console him, and had him taken
by the surgeon to the infirmary.” The case seemed
to require full investigation, which it received; and
the result is recorded a little further on by the governor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
“It appeared that up to two or three days
before he had been remarkably cheerful. But one
day some extra soup had disagreed with him, after
which he hardly spoke, not even to his partner with
whom he walked in the yard.” Then, when he
thought he was unobserved, he had secreted the
hammock lashing which was to put an end to his
wretched existence.</p>

<p>Bile or indigestion have doubtless driven many
to desperation; but though the saying is common
enough, that life under such afflictions is barely
worth having, actual cases of suicide from stomachic
derangements are comparatively rare. Perhaps
the soup story opened the governor’s eyes a
little to the prisoner’s real character, and then, later
on, a second detection of fraud proved beyond doubt
that Edwards was an impostor.</p>

<p>He was caught in a clandestine correspondence
with his relatives outside, and for this he was transferred
to “the dark.” Fifteen minutes afterwards
they find him suspended from the top of his cell
gate by his pocket handkerchief. They cut him
down at once. He pretends to be unable to speak,
yet it is clear that he has not done himself the
slightest injury. Nevertheless, to keep him out of
mischief, he is removed to the infirmary and put
into a strait jacket. To escape from this restraint
he embarks upon a new line of imposture. He sends
an urgent message to the chaplain, having, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
asserts, a weighty sin upon his conscience, which
he wishes at once to disclose.</p>

<p>“Some four years ago, sir, I murdered a young
woman. She was the one I kept company with. I
was jealous. I threw her into the New River. Sir,
I have never had a happy moment since I committed
the deed. My life is a burthen to me; and I
would gladly terminate it upon the scaffold.”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure you are telling me the
truth?” the chaplain asks.</p>

<p>“The truth, sir&mdash;God’s truth. If I am not, may
I,” etc.</p>

<p>He detailed the circumstances of the murder with
so much circumstantiality that it was thought advisable
to take all down in writing, so as to make
full inquiry; but both governor and chaplain were
“fully convinced that the prisoner had fabricated
the whole story in the hopes of getting himself removed
to Newgate.” No sort of corroboration was
obtained outside, of course, and by and by the matter
dropped. I have merely quoted this as a sequel
and commentary upon the conduct of Edwards,
proving that he was clearly an impostor from first
to last.</p>

<p>But not long after this a fatal case occurred. The
suicide was a man long suspected of being wrong
in his head. Early one morning he was found hanging
to the cross beam of his loom, from the framework
of which he had jumped, and thereby dislocated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
his neck. It appeared on inquiry, that the
mental derangement of which this man showed
symptoms had been kept quite a secret from the
governor and medical officer; so also had his frequent
requests to see the chaplain; and the officer
in charge of the ward was very properly suspended
from duty “for culpable neglect, as probably, with
timely interference, the prisoner’s life might have
been saved.” But whether it might or might not,
the news of his death spread rapidly through the
prison, and from having occurred but rarely, real or
feigned suicides became again quite the fashion.
The gossip of an incautious matron took the intelligence
first into the female pentagon. That very
evening, after the women had been locked up, one
yelled to another in the next cell that she meant to
hang herself directly, and had a rope concealed,
which she dared any one to discover. This woman
was made safe at once; but next morning another
was found tied up by her apron to the pegs of the
clothes rack behind her cell door. She had failed
to come out with the rest to wash, and as the officers
approached to examine her cell they heard a noise
of groaning within. A sort of feeble barricade had
been made by the prisoner, with her mattress and
pillows, to prevent entrance; but the door was easily
opened, and behind it hung Hannah Groats by the
neck, to one peg, while she carefully kept herself
from harm by holding on by her hands to the two
pegs adjoining. She was instantly taken down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
when it was seen that she had not sustained the
slightest damage. She had, of course, chosen her
time just when she knew the cell doors were about
to be opened, and she was sure to be quickly discovered.</p>

<p>Next the men took up the contagion. One announced
that unless he be removed without delay
from the cell he occupied he should forthwith make
away with himself, as he was tired of life. “He
appeared so much dejected, and spoke with such
apparent earnestness, that I ordered him to the infirmary,”
says the governor. Another man writes
on his slate that the authorities treat him with such
severity, he shall certainly commit suicide. He is
seen at once by both chaplain and governor, but
continues “dogged and intractable.” Then a certain
impudent young vagabond, notorious for his
continual misconduct, is found one morning seated
at his table, reading the burial service aloud from
his prayer-book, and sharpening his knife on a bit
of hearth-stone; a woman is discovered with a piece
of linen tied tightly round her neck, and nearly producing
strangulation; men, one after another, are
found suspended, but always cut down promptly,
and proved unhurt in spite of pretended insensibility:
cases of this kind really occurred so frequently,
that I should fill many pages were I to recount
a tithe of them.</p>

<p>I will describe the first instance in which it was
found necessary to inflict corporal punishment in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Millbank, which was as a punishment for a brutal
assault. One of the prisoners, David Sheppard,
checked mildly by his officer for walking in his
wrong place, replied, “I’ll walk as I have always
done, and not otherwise.”</p>

<p>“You must walk with your partner.”</p>

<p>“What is that you say? I’ll partner you,” exclaimed
Sheppard most insolently; an answer that
is conclusive evidence as to the sort of discipline
maintained in the prison.</p>

<p>The officer made no further remark, but walked
away to unlock a gate. Sheppard followed him
quickly, and without the least notice, struck him a
tremendous blow behind the ear, striking him again
and again till other officers came to the victim’s
assistance. Many of the prisoners cried “Leave
off!” but none offered to interfere. As soon as the
prisoner had been secured, he was carried before the
governor. The assault was brutal and unprovoked,
and seemed to call for immediate example. Under
the recent Act, it had become lawful to inflict corporal
punishment in serious cases, and now for the
first time this power was made available. The prisoner
Sheppard was sent to the Queen’s Square
police office, and arraigned before the sitting magistrate,
who sentenced him forthwith to “one hundred
and fifty lashes on the bare back.” The whole of
the prisoners of the D ward, to which Sheppard
belonged, were therefore assembled in the yard, and
the culprit tied up to iron railings in the circle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
“Having addressed the prisoner,” says the governor,
“on this disgraceful circumstance, I had one
hundred lashes applied by Warder Aulph, an old
farrier of the cavalry, and therefore well accustomed
to inflict corporal punishment, who volunteered
his services. The surgeon attended, and he
being of opinion that Sheppard had received enough,
I remitted the remainder of his sentence, on an
understanding to that effect with Mr. Gregory (the
sitting magistrate). The lashes were not very
severely inflicted, but were sufficient for example.
Sheppard, when taken down, owned the justice of
his sentence, and, addressing his fellow-prisoners,
said he hoped it would be a warning to them. He
was then taken to the infirmary.” A strong force
of extra warders was present to overawe the spectators;
but all the prisoners behaved well, except
one who yelled “Murder” several times, which was
answered from the windows above, whence came
also cries of “Shame.” Another, who had been
guilty some months before of a similar offence, witnessed
the operation. It affected him to tears. “He
was much frightened, and promised to behave better
for the future.”</p>

<p>It is impossible to read this account of the infliction
of what seemed a highly necessary chastisement
without noticing the peculiar sensitiveness of the
prison authorities on the subject. In these days
there are crowds of thin-skinned philanthropists,
ever ready to loudly rail against the use of the lash,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
even upon garroters and the cowards who beat their
wives. But in the time of which I am writing&mdash;in
1830 that is to say, when soldiers, for purely military
offences, were flogged within an inch of their
lives, and the “cat” alone kept the slave population
of penal colonies in subjection&mdash;it is almost amusing
to observe what a coil was raised about a single
instance of corporal punishment. Were proof required
of the exceeding mildness of the rule under
which Millbank was governed, we should have it
here.</p>

<p>Between this and the next assault there was a
long interval. But after a little more than twelve
months had elapsed, the ferocity of these candidates
for reformation again made itself apparent. This
time it was a concerted affair between two prisoners
who fancied themselves aggrieved by the stern severity
of their officer, Mr. Young. These men,
Morris and King, had been reported for talking
to each other from cell to cell. Next day both were
let out to throw away the water in which they had
washed. They met at the trough, and recommenced
conversation which had been interrupted the day
before.</p>

<p>“At your old tricks, eh?” cried Mr. Young.
“I shall have to report you again.”</p>

<p>“You lie, you rascal,” shouted Morris, suddenly
drawing a sleeveboard which he had concealed behind
his back. Holding this by the small end with
both hands, he aimed several tremendous blows at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Mr. Young’s head, which the latter managed to
ward off partly, with his arms. But now King,
armed with a pewter basin in one hand and a tailor’s
iron in the other, attacked him from behind. Soon
Mr. Young’s keys were knocked away from him,
and he himself brought to the ground. However,
he managed to regain his legs, and then made off,
closely pursued by his assailants, who, flourishing
their weapons and smashing everything fragile in
their progress, drove him at length into a corner,
got him down, beat him unmercifully, and left him
for dead, King throwing the basin behind him as
a parting shot.</p>

<p>Mr. Young’s cries of “Murder!” had been continuous.
They were re-echoed by the shouts of the
many prisoners who, standing at their open cell
doors, were spectators of the scene. One man,
Nolan, climbing up to his window, gave the alarm
to the tower below. Assistance soon arrived&mdash;the
taskmaster followed by two others, who met first
Morris and King as they were returning to their
cells. “What has happened?” they asked. “I
haven’t an idea,” Morris replied coolly. King, too,
is equally in the dark. The officers pass on and
come to other cells, in which the prisoners are seen
grinning as if in high glee, and when questioned
they only laugh the more. But at length Nolan is
reached. “Oh, sir,” says Nolan at once, through
the bars of his gate, “they’ve murdered the officer,
Mr. Young, sir. There lie his keys, and his body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
is a little further on.” At this moment, however,
Mr. Young is seen dragging himself slowly towards
them, evidently seriously injured and hardly able
to walk. He just manages to explain what has happened,
and as the governor has by this time also
arrived, the offenders are secured and carried off
to the refractory cells.</p>

<p>Here was another case in which a prompt exhibition
of the “cat” would probably have been attended
with the best results. But for some reason
or other this course was not adopted; the prisoners
Morris and King were remanded for trial at the
next Clerkenwell Assizes, where, many months
afterwards, they were sentenced to an additional
year’s imprisonment. So far as I can discover, in
these times the power to inflict corporal punishment
in the Penitentiary was very sparingly employed.
No other case beyond that which I have just described
appears recorded in the journals till some
four years afterwards, in 1834, when a prisoner
having attacked his officer with a shoe frame, the
sitting magistrate ordered him to be flogged with
as little delay as possible. For this purpose the
services of the public executioner were obtained
from Newgate, and one hundred out of the three
hundred lashes ordered were laid on “not very
severely.” A large gathering of the worst behaved
prisoners witnessed the punishment; but all were
very quiet. “Not a word was spoken, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
many were in tears.” “I fervently hope,” says
Captain Chapman, “that this painful discharge of
my duty may be productive of that to which all punishment
tends&mdash;the prevention of crime.”</p>

<h3>A NEW REGIME</h3>

<p class="pch">Present system faulty everywhere&mdash;Reforms contemplated&mdash;Too
great intercourse among prisoners condemned&mdash;Labour
for the spiritual welfare of the prisoners becomes
a leading idea&mdash;Unwearied zeal and activity of the chaplain&mdash;Succeeded
by Mr. Nihil who combines the offices
of chaplain and governor&mdash;Admonition and persuasion are
the leading principles of the new Penal Discipline&mdash;The
chaplain-governor’s difficulties and vexations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> now come to another stage in the onward
career of the Penitentiary. The committee, compelled
to admit that the discipline was not sufficiently
severe, resolved to tighten the reins. In
order to understand this decision we must take into
consideration certain influences at work outside the
walls.</p>

<p>There was, about this time, a sort of panic in the
country at the alarming prevalence of crime in England.
Its continuous and extraordinary growth
was certainly enough to cause uneasiness. In the
years between December, 1817, and December,
1831, it had increased one hundred and forty per
cent. For this there was more than one reason, of
course. One, and no insignificant cause, was the
comparative immunity enjoyed by offenders. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
came now to be understood that the lot of the transgressor
was far from hard. The system of secondary
punishments in force for their correction was
felt to be inadequate, either to reform criminals or
deter from crime. Here was an explanation: evidently
a screw was loose in the way in which the
sentence of the law was executed. The judges and
the juries did their duty, but the criminal snapped
his fingers at the ordeal to which they subjected
him. This discontent with the system of imprisonment
grew and gained strength, till at last the whole
question of secondary punishments was referred to
a Select Committee of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>All prisoners found guilty of non-capital crimes
were at that time disposed of by committal for short
periods to the county gaols and houses of correction,
or they were sentenced to transportation for various
terms of years. Those whose fate brought them
within the latter category were further disposed of,
according to the will of the Home Secretary, in one
of three ways: either, by committal to Millbank
Penitentiary; or, by removal to the hulks; or,
finally, by actual deportation to the penal colonies
beyond the seas. There were therefore four outlets
for the criminal. How he fared in each case, according
as his fate overtook him, I shall describe
hereafter.</p>

<p>The county gaols were in these days still faulty.
They made no attempt to reform the morals of
their inmates, nor could they be said to diminish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
crime by the severity of their discipline. Indeed,
they held out scarcely any terrors to offenders. Of
one of the largest, Coldbath Fields, Mr. Chesterton,
who was appointed its governor in 1829, speaks in
the plainest terms. “It was a sink of abomination
and pollution. The female side was only half fenced
off from the male&mdash;evidently with an infamous intention;
its corrupt functionaries played into each
other’s hands to prevent an inquiry or exposure.
None of the authorities who ruled the prison had
acquired any definite notion of the wide-spread defilement
that polluted every hole and corner of that
Augean stable. Shameless gains were promoted by
the encouragement of all that was lawless and execrable.”
The same writer describes Newgate,
which he visited, as presenting “a hideous combination
of all that was revolting.” The thieves confined
therein smoked short pipes, gamed, swore, and
fought through half the night: the place was like
a pandemonium. Again, when he saw them, “The
prisons of Bury St. Edmund’s, Salford, and Kirkdale
created in my mind irrepressible disgust. I
wondered why such detestable haunts should be
tolerated.” Gaolers and criminals were on the best
of terms with each other. At Ilchester the governor
was in the habit of playing whist with his prisoners,
and at Coldbath Fields the turnkeys shook hands
with new arrivals and promised to take “all possible
care” of them. With all this there was such
a deficiency of control that unlimited intercourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
could not be prevented, and there followed naturally
that corruption of innocent prisoners by the more
depraved which was a bugbear even in the time of
John Howard.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was a wonder that Howard did not
rise from his grave. Half a century had elapsed
since his voice first was heard, and yet corrupt practices,
idleness, and wide-spread demoralization characterized
the greater part of the small prisons in the
country. Herein were confined the lesser lights of
the great army of crime, and if they escaped thus
easily, it could not be said that the more advanced
criminals endured a lot that was much more severe.
The reader has, perhaps, some notion by this time
of the kind of punishment to be met with in the
walls of the Penitentiary; the hulks, too, have already
been mentioned. The third method of coercion,
by transportation, that is to say, beyond the
seas, remains to be described; but this I reserve for
a later page, recording only here the opinion of the
committee of 1831, that as a punishment transportation
held out to the dangerous classes absolutely
no terrors at all. “Indeed, from accounts sent
home, the situation of the convict is so comfortable,
his advancement, if he conducts himself with prudence,
so sure, as to produce a strong impression
that transportation may be considered rather an advantage
than a punishment.”</p>

<p>After a long and careful investigation, the committee
wound up their report with the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
pregnant words: “Your committee having now
passed in review the different modes of secondary
punishment known to the practice of this country,
wish once more to direct the attention of the House
to their obvious tendency. If it is a principle of
our criminal jurisprudence, that the guilty should
escape rather than the innocent suffer, it appears
equally a principle, in the infliction of punishment,
that every regulation connected with it, from the
first committal of a prisoner to gaol to the termination
of his sentence of transportation, should be
characterized rather by an anxious care for the
health and convenience of the criminal than for anything
which might even by implication appear to
bear on him with undue severity.”</p>

<p>The authorities at Millbank now wished to set
their house in order. With the publication of this
parliamentary report, the managers of Millbank
awoke all at once to the true condition of the prison.
On account of the repeated “irregularities” laid before
them, they now considered it necessary to ascertain
whether any, and what abuses existed; and
whether there were any and what defects in the system
upon which the prison was conducted. The
whole subject was therefore entrusted to a sub-committee,
which, after some months of patient investigation,
was of opinion that all the irregularities
arose from “the too great intercourse which the
present system permits prisoners to hold with one
another. The comparatively ignorant are thus instructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
in schemes and modes of vice by the hardened
and the depraved; and those upon whom good
impressions have been made are ridiculed and
shamed out of their resolutions by associating with
the profligate.” We have here an admission that
one of the old evils of prison life&mdash;indiscriminate
association&mdash;which was to have been abolished by
the Penitentiary system, was still in full vigour, and
that in fact it had never been interfered with.</p>

<p>The committee arrived therefore at the conviction
“that the prosperity and well-being of the establishment
must depend upon effecting a more
strict seclusion of the prisoners, one from another.”
At the same time a new chaplain, Mr. Whitworth
Russell, who became largely identified with prisons
and penal discipline, urgently recommended a
greater development of religious instruction. He
proposed that in future the open part of the Millbank
chapel should be provided with benches, so
that he might assemble daily, large classes for religious
instruction. To these classes he was to devote
three hours every morning, the schoolmaster
performing the same duty in the afternoon. During
the morning instruction by the chaplain this
schoolmaster had to visit the prisoners, cell by cell,
either collecting information, as to the previous
habits and connections of the prisoners, or carrying
on the instruction commenced at school or the lectures
in chapel. In this we find the key-note of the
new system that was from now on to prevail with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
increasing strength, till by and by, as we shall see,
it grew to be altogether supreme.</p>

<p>Never since the opening of Millbank, in 1817,
had the spiritual welfare of the prisoners been forgotten,
nor the hope abandoned of reforming them
by religious influences. But now, and for years to
come, the chaplain was to have the fullest scope.
Whether much tangible benefit followed from his
increasing ministrations, will be best shown in the
later development of the narrative; but it cannot
be denied that the efforts of Mr. Whitworth Russell,
and of his successor, Mr. Nihil, who in himself
combined the offices of governor and chaplain, were
praiseworthy in the extreme. Speaking, however,
with all due reverence, I cannot but think that their
zeal was often misdirected; that conversion, such
as it is, obtained by force almost, could never be
either sincere or lasting; and in short, that the continued
parade of sacred things tended rather to drag
them into the mire, while the incessant religious exercises&mdash;the
prayers, expositions, and genuflexions,
were more in keeping with a monastery of monks
than a gaol full of criminals.</p>

<p>There are numberless instances scattered up and
down among the records of the sort of spirit in
which the prisoners received their sacred instruction.
It was the custom for a monitor, specially selected
from among the prisoners, to read aloud the morning
and evening service in each ward. He was frequently
disturbed. Once when Balaam’s name appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
in the lesson, it was twisted into “Ba&mdash;a&mdash;Lamb!”
and as such went echoing along with peals
of laughter from cell to cell. The monitor was frequently
called upon for a song just before he gave
out the hymn; others mocked him as he sang, and
sang ribald verses so loud as to drown the voices
of the rest; many said they couldn’t sing, and nothing
should compel them; often they would not join
in the Lord’s Prayer&mdash;there was no law, they said,
to make them say their prayers against their will.
Then a certain Joseph Wells, an old offender, was
reported for writing on his pint cup these lines:&mdash;</p>

<table id="t01" summary="t01">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdc">“Yor order is</td>
  <td class="tdc">but mine is</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdc">for me to go</td>
  <td class="tdc">that I’ll go to</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdc">to chapel,</td>
  <td class="tdc">Hell first”;</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn1">and when remonstrated with, he merely laughed in
the governor’s face. There was constant antagonism
between the prisoners and their comrade the
monitor, generally over the church catechism, in
which, as a species of chaplain’s assistant, the latter
had to instruct the others. “What’s your name?”
he asked one. “George Ward; and you know it as
well as I do,” replied the prisoner. Another read
his answers out of the book. The monitor suggested
that by this time he ought to know the catechism
by heart. “Ah, every one hasn’t got the gift
of the gab like you have. And look here, don’t talk
to me again like that, or you’ll be sorry for it.”
Again, as a proof of the glibness with which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
could quote scriptural language, I must insert here
a strange rhapsody found on a prisoner’s slate. He
pretended to be dumb, and when spoken to, he
merely shook his head and pointed to the writing,
which was as follows:</p>

<p class="p2">“<span class="smcap">My kind Governor</span>,&mdash;I hope you will hearken
unto me, as your best friend; in truth I am no
prophet, though I am sent to bear witness as a
prophet. For behold my God came walking on the
water, and came toward me where I stood, and said
unto me, Fear not to speak, for I am with you.
Therefore I shall open my mouth in prophesies, and
therefore do not question me too much; but if you
will ear my words, call your nobles together, and
<i>then</i> I will speak unto you of all he has given me in
power, and the things I shall say unto you shall
come to pass within 12 months; therefore be on
your guard, and mind what you say unto me, for
there be a tremor on all them that ear me speak, for
I shall make your ears to tingle. And the first
parable I shall speak is this: Behold, out of the mire
shall come forth brightness against thee.”</p>

<p class="p2">This man, when brought before the governor,
continued obstinately dumb. The surgeon consulted
was satisfied he was shamming, but still the
prisoner persisted in keeping silence. “Is there any
reason why he should not go to ‘the dark?’” the
surgeon was asked. “Certainly not; on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
I think it would be of service to him,” answered
the surgeon; and to the dark he was sent,
remaining for six days, till he voluntarily relinquished
the imposture.</p>

<p>The energy and determination of the new chaplain,
who was appointed about the time the new
system was established, were very remarkable. He
was a man of decided ability, and his influence could
not fail to be soon felt throughout the prison. Perhaps
in manner he was somewhat overbearing, and
disposed to trench on the prerogative of the governor
as to the discipline of the establishment. He
soon came into collision with the prisoners. Many
“tried it on,” as the saying was, with him, but signally
failed; and any who were guilty of even the
slightest disrespect were immediately punished. Mr.
Russell constantly reported cases of misconduct.
Thus, having asked at school, whether any present
had been unable to write on coming into prison, a
man named Fleming, answered, “Yes! I could
not.”</p>

<p>“You have every cause to be thankful, then, for
the opportunities afforded you here.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Fleming. “I have reason
to curse the Penitentiary and everybody belonging
to it.”</p>

<p>“Be silent,” said the chaplain, “I shall not stand
by and listen to such reprehensible language.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not be gagged, I shall speak the truth,” persisted
Fleming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>And for this without loss of time he was transferred
to the dark.</p>

<p>All the chaplain’s professional feelings were also
roused by another incident that transpired not long
after his arrival. It was discovered that a prisoner,
George Anderson, a man of colour, who had been
educated at a missionary college, had through the
connivance of a warder been endeavouring to sow
the seeds of disbelief in the minds of many of the
prisoners. He had turned the chaplain and his
sacred office into ridicule, asserting that the services
of the Church of England were nonsense from beginning
to end, that the prayers contained false doctrine,
that the Athanasian Creed was all rubbish,
and that the church “went with a lie in her right
hand.” This man Anderson must have been a thorn
in the chaplain’s side, for they had more than once
a serious scuffle in the polemics of the church. Mr.
Russell got warm in the discussion of a certain passage
in Scripture, and jumping up suddenly to reach
his Bible, struck his leg against the table. After
this Anderson had drawn a caricature of the scene,
writing underneath, “Oh, my leg!” and from
henceforth the chaplain went by the name of “Oh,
my leg.” At another time there was a long dispute
as to the date of the translation of the Septuagint,
and upon the service for “the Visitation of the
Sick.” Anderson, on returning to his cell from Mr.
Russell’s office, had been in the habit of taking off
his coat, and shaking it, saying always: “Peugh&mdash;&mdash; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
smell of fire and brimstone.” One cannot
refrain from observing here how much better oakum
picking would have suited Anderson than theological
controversy.</p>

<p>Fortunately among the prisoners were two&mdash;Johnson
and Manister Worts&mdash;who were more
than a match for the unorthodox black man. Anderson
asserted that the Athanasian Creed was objected
to by many able divines; he took exception
to the title, “religious” given to the king in the
prayer for the High Court of Parliament, whether
he was religious or not; he maintained that his animadversions
upon the church were the very words
used by his former pastor, the Reverend Silas
Fletcher, from the pulpit. The knowledge and acquirements
of Johnson and Worts however enabled
them “triumphantly to refute Anderson.”</p>

<p>Nor were the women behindhand in giving the
chaplain annoyance. In the middle of the service
on one occasion a woman jumped up on to her seat,
crying out, “Mr. Russell, Mr. Russell, as this may
be the last time I shall be at church, I return you
thanks for all favours.” The chaplain replied
gravely that the House of God was no place for her
to address him, but the attention of the male prisoners
in the body of the chapel below was attracted,
and it was with some difficulty that a general disturbance
was prevented. At another time there was
actually a row in the church. Just as the sermon
began, a loud scream or huzza was heard among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
females. At first it was supposed that some woman
was in a fit, but the next moment half a dozen
prayer-books were flung at the chaplain’s head in
the pulpit. With some difficulty the culprits were
removed before the uproar became general; but as
soon as the chaplain had finished his sermon, and
said “Let us pray,” a voice was heard audibly
through the building replying, “No, we have had
praying enough.” A year or two later a more serious
affair was only prevented with difficulty, when
the women in the galleries above plotted to join the
men in the body of the church below in some desperate
act.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitworth Russell, however, through it all
continued to exhibit the same unwearied activity and
zeal. He never spared himself; and as the years
passed by, he became known as one experienced in
all that concerned prisons and their inmates. Therefore,
when the cry for prison reform echoed loudly
through the land, he was at once named one of Her
Majesty’s inspectors of prisons. His colleague was
Mr. Crawford, who had made a lengthened visitation
of the prisons in the United States, and the two
divided the whole of Great Britain between them
and vigorously applied themselves to their task.</p>

<p>Mr. Russell was succeeded as chaplain at Millbank
by the Rev. Daniel Nihil, a gentleman who
soon gave satisfactory evidence that he was worthy
to wear his predecessor’s mantle. All that Mr. Russell
did, Mr. Nihil did also, and more. Ere long he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
found himself so firmly established in the good
graces of the committee, that he was soon raised by
them to wider, if not higher, functions, and in 1837
it was decided that he should hold the appointment
of both governor and chaplain combined.</p>

<p>On the 15th of April in that year, the governor,
Captain Chapman, wrote to tender his resignation
for various reasons. “The changes that have taken
place, those about to be introduced by the new Bill,
his advanced age and indifferent health, induced
him to consider it due to the public service to retire,
for the purpose of enabling the committee to supply
his place by the appointment of an officer who might
begin the new system at its commencement.” In
reply came a gracious message from the committee,
to the effect that they were aware of the “unwearied
assiduity, zeal, and ability” with which he had discharged
his arduous duties for fourteen years, and
they recommended him “for the most liberal and
favourable consideration of the Secretary of State,
on account of his long and faithful services.” At
the same meeting it was at once mooted that Mr.
Nihil should succeed to the vacancy.</p>

<p>Some account may here be given of the chaplain’s
reign in the Penitentiary. It will be seen at once
that his appointment as head of the establishment
sufficiently shows the influences that were in ascendancy
with the committee of the Penitentiary. This
body was not alone and peculiar in its views; the
general tone of public opinion at that time turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
towards entrusting the ministers of religion with
full powers to preach prisoners out of their evil
courses into honesty and the right path. Far be it
from me to detract from the efforts made in such
a cause; but they are liable to be misconstrued.
The objects of so much tender solicitude are apt to
take the kindness that is well meant, for weakness,
and wax in consequence insolent and unmanageable.
The Millbank committee were sanguine still, in
1838, when Mr. Nihil came into power under them.
We shall see now how far their agent, having <i>carte
blanche</i> and every facility, prospered in this difficult
mission. His real earnestness of purpose, and the
thoroughness of his convictions, were incontestable.</p>

<p>Immediately on assuming the reins Mr. Nihil applied
himself with all the energy of his evidently
vigorous mind to the task before him, seeking at
once to imbue his subordinates with something of
his own spirit, and proclaiming in plain terms, to
both officers and prisoners, his conception of the
proper character of the institution he was called
upon to rule. He considered it “a penal establishment,
constituted with a view to the real reformation
of convicts through the instrumentality of
moral and religious means;” and in the official
records made the following entry, wherein he intimated
his views, and appealed to those under him
for co-operation and support.</p>

<p>“Having, in my capacity of chaplain, observed
the injurious effects arising from a habit which appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
prevalent among the inferior officers, of regarding
our religious rules as empty forms, got up
for the sole purpose of prison discipline, and conceiving
it right to let them understand the principles
on which I propose to administer the prison, I drew
up, and have since circulated, the following intimation:</p>

<p>“Having been appointed governor of this institution,
I desire to express to the inferior officers my
earnest and sincere hope that they will one and all
bear in mind the objects of a penitentiary. The reformation
of persons who have been engaged in
criminal acts and habits is the most difficult work
in the world. God alone, who rules the heart, can
accomplish it; but God requires means to be used
by man, and amongst the means used here, none are
more important than the treatment of prisoners by
the officers in charge of them. That treatment
should always be regulated by religious principle.
It should be mild, yet firm, just, impartial, and
steady. In delivering orders to prisoners, care
should be taken to avoid unnecessary offence and
irritation, at the same time that those orders are
marked by authority. Command of temper should
be particularly cultivated. The rules require certain
religious observances. It is of the greatest
importance that the officers should always remember
the reverence which belongs to sacred things,
otherwise the prisoners will be apt to regard them
not as religious services, but as matters of prison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
discipline. It should appear that officers themselves
have a concern in religion and love and venerate
it for its own sake. I do not by any means wish
them to put on an appearance of religion which they
do not feel&mdash;that would be hypocrisy,&mdash;but I wish
them, as members of a religious institution, to cultivate
the feeling and demeanour of true Christians&mdash;not
only for the sake of the prisoners under their
charge, but for their own.”</p>

<p>That the intention of this order was of the best
no one who reads it can deny; but its provisions
were fraught with mischievous consequences, as
will soon appear. It struck at the root of all discipline.
The prisoners were insubordinate and
insolent, and needed peremptory measures to keep
them in check; they were already only too much
disposed to give themselves airs, and quite absurdly
puffed up with an idea of their own importance. In
all this they were now to be directly encouraged;
for although the order in question was not made
known to them in so many words, they were quick
witted enough, as they always are, to detect the
altered attitude of their masters. These masters
were such, however, only in name; and one of them
within a month complains rather bitterly that he is
worse off than a prisoner. The latter, if charged
with an offence, need only deny it and it fell to the
ground, while a prisoner might say what he liked
against an officer and it could not be refuted. The
governor did not at first see how injudicious it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to weaken the authority of his subordinates, and
continued to inculcate mildness of demeanour. In
a serious case of disturbance, where several prisoners
were most turbulent and needed summary repression,
he took a very old warder to task for his
unnecessary severity. One of these mutineers,
whom they had been obliged to remove by force,
cried, “You have almost killed me,” though nothing
of the kind had occurred. This officer was injudicious
enough to reply, “You deserve killing.”
Upon this Mr. Nihil, as I find it recorded, states,
“I thought it necessary to reprove the warder for
such language. If the prisoners are to be properly
managed, it is by authority administered with firmness,
and guided, not by passion, but by reason and
principle.”</p>

<p>Later he issued the following order: “In consequence
of what the governor has sometimes observed,
he wishes to impress on the inferior officers
the importance of coolness and command of temper
in the management of prisoners.... Cases will,
of course, arise when prisoners by their violence
give much provocation. At such times it is particularly
necessary that the officers should endeavour
to maintain calmness and self-possession. The best
way is to use as few words as possible, taking care
at the same time to adopt the necessary means of
securing a refractory prisoner; but to fall into a
passion, or to enter into a war of words, only lowers
the authority of the officer, and adds to the irritation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
it is intended to allay.” Excellent advice, but not
always easily followed.</p>

<p>Indeed, the condition of his officers was hardly
to be envied. They were mostly men of the camp,
soldiers who had served their time in the army, little
fitted either by previous training or the habits of
their mind for the task required of them now. Mr.
Nihil, to be fully served and seconded in his conscientious
efforts to effect reformation, should have
been provided with a staff of missionaries; though
these were hardly to be got for the money, nor
would they have been found of much assistance in
carrying out the discipline of the prison. As it was,
the warders had to choose between becoming hypocrites,
or running the risk of daily charges of irreligious
impropriety, and of losing their situations
altogether. Placed thus from the first in a false
position, there was some excuse for them in their
shortcomings. It is not strange that many went
with the stream, and sought to obtain credit by professing
piety whether they felt it or not, using scripture
phrases, and parading in the pentagons and
ward passages with Bibles carried ostentatiously
under their arms, though it could be proved, and
was, that many of the same men when safe beyond
the walls were notorious for debauchery and looseness
of life. It was in these days that a curious
epithet came to distinguish all who were known as
the chaplain’s men. They were called in the thieves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>’
<i>argot</i> “Pantilers,” and the title sticks to them still.
The “pantile,” according to the slang dictionary,
from which I must perforce quote, was the broad-brimmed
hat worn by the puritans of old. From
this strange origin is derived a word which, with
the lower orders, is synonymous still with cant and
a hypocritical profession of religion to serve base
ends. Millbank was long known as the headquarters
of the “Pantilers.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, officers in whom the old mammon
was too strong to be stifled altogether, occasionally
forgot themselves, and when accused or
suspected of unorthodoxy or unbelief they naturally
went to the wall. Thus it was not likely that one
who was reported to be a confirmed infidel would
escape instant dismissal; though in one instance the
information was given by a prisoner, and should at
least have been received with caution. The substance
of the complaint made by the prisoner was
that the officer had asserted that the nature of man
was sinful, but that the worst man that ever lived
was no worse than God had made him, with other
remarks of a carping and irreverent character. Mr.
Nihil immediately sent for both officer and prisoner,
and confronted them together, questioning the
former as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mr. Mann, are you a member of the Church of
England?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“To what church, then, do you belong?”</p>

<p>“I was brought up a Baptist, sir; but I am not
a member of any society at present.”</p>

<p>“Are you a believer in the Scriptures?”</p>

<p>“I would rather not enter into that subject.”</p>

<p>“Did you not represent yourself a member of the
Church of England when first employed?”</p>

<p>“I did not. I was never asked the question.”</p>

<p>He was then asked if he had ever tried to controvert
the religion of the Penitentiary, but he distinctly
denied having done so.</p>

<p>Then came the prisoner’s turn.</p>

<p>“I assure you, sir,” he told Mr. Nihil, “that this
officer on one occasion remarked to me that St. Paul
took up several chapters in telling women what sort
of ribbons they wore in their bonnets.” And on this
evidence Mr. Mann lost his situation; for, says the
Governor, “I considered his answers evasive
throughout; while the prisoner being an exceedingly
well-conducted man, I have no doubt, from
the tenour of the whole proceedings, that he spoke
the truth.” Hard measure this, and scarcely calculated
to maintain the discipline of the establishment.</p>

<p>Still harder, perhaps, was the dismissal of another
officer, who was found using what was characterized
as a species of low slang in speaking of prisoners.
“It came out very artlessly,” says Mr. Nihil, “as
he was telling me of some boyish irregularity of a
prisoner, whom he styled a ‘rascal.’ This, coupled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
with other appearances, determined me that the man
may have meant no great harm, but that he was
quite unfit for the moral charge here entrusted to
him; and I thought it necessary, not only in regard
to this offence, but that others might take a lesson
from it, to mark my sense of the unfitness of one
in the habit of familiarly using such language for
the situation of warder.” When a fate so severe
overtook these two for the offences recorded, a
third was not likely to escape who was proved to
have occasionally sworn, and who admitted that he
considered it was all humbug taking the prisoners
to chapel. Although this culprit held the grade of
taskmaster, and had completed a service of many
years, he too was forthwith sent about his business.
But then it was brought home to him that he had
once been heard to say, “The governor thinks himself
a sharp fellow&mdash;I think him the&mdash;&mdash; fool I
ever knew.” It also appeared that this officer’s
familiar language among other officers was very
profane. He sometimes ridiculed religion; and at
one time scoffed at the miracle of the sun standing
still. On one occasion he spoke of the chaplain’s
lectures as humbug. “My own impressions of T.,”
says the governor-chaplain, “were that though he
was an efficient officer, he was a conceited self-sufficient
man, and of his moral principles I had no
good opinion. Everything led to the conviction
that he was a very dangerous character in an institution
of this kind; his general bearing giving him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
influence over the inferior officers, and his principles
and habits being such as to turn that influence to
pernicious account.” He was accordingly dismissed
by the committee “with the strongest reprobation
of his abominable hypocrisy.”</p>

<p>Although thus studiously bent upon raising the
moral tone of his officers, in many other respects,
hardly of inferior importance, the utmost laxity prevailed.
The rules by which the Penitentiary was
governed, and by which all undue familiarity between
officers and prisoners was strictly prohibited;
which forbade certain luxuries, such as tobacco,
ardent spirits, and the morning papers; and which
insisted upon certain principles to insure the safe
custody of those confined&mdash;all these were often
contravened or neglected. Upon no one point are
gaolers bound to be more vigilant and circumspect
than in the security of their keys. In all well-ordered
prisons now the most stringent rules prevail
on this head. To lose a key entails exemplary punishment,
heavy fines, or immediate dismissal. Yet
in these old Millbank days we find an officer coolly
lending his keys to a prisoner to let himself in and
out of his ward; and another who wakes up in the
morning without them, asserts at once that they
have been stolen from him in the night. In this
latter case instant search was made, and after a
long delay one key was found in the ventilator of
a prisoner’s cell, and below his window, outside, the
remaining three. This man was of course accused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of the theft; and a circumstantial story at once invented,
of his escaping after school, repairing to the
tower, and possessing himself of the keys. He
would infallibly have suffered for the offence, had
it not been accidentally discovered that the officer
who had lost them was drunk and incapable on the
night in question, and had himself dropped them
from his pocket. There was more than one escape,
which though ingeniously conceived and carried out
could never have succeeded but for a want of watchfulness
and supervision on the part of the officer.
Of the improper intimacy there could be little doubt,
when it was proved that officers and old prisoners
were seen in company at public houses&mdash;the latter
standing treat, and supplying bribes freely, to compass
the conveyance to their friends, still inside, of
the luxuries prohibited by the rules. All this came
out one fine day, when it was discovered that,
through the connivance of certain dishonest warders,
several prisoners had been regularly supplied with
magazines and morning newspapers. Wine, spirits,
and eatables more toothsome than the prison fare,
and the much-loved weed, found their way into the
prison by the same reprehensible means. It is but
fair to add here, that in this and in every other case,
as soon as the irregularities referred to were
brought to light, they were invariably visited with
the condemnation they deserved.</p>

<p>Even a man of shrewd intelligence like Mr. Nihil
could not fail to be occasionally taken in. On one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
or two points he was especially vulnerable. Signs
of repentance, real or feigned, won from him at
once an earnest sympathy which not seldom proved
to be cruelly misplaced. There was also a certain
simplicity about him, and want of experience, that
sometimes made him the dupe of his subordinates
when they tried to curry favour by exaggerating
the sufferings of the prisoners. One day when he
was <i>en route</i> to the dark cells, intending to pardon
a culprit therein confined, the taskmaster who accompanied
him voluntarily observed, “You are
quite right to release him, sir. His legs would get
affected, I am afraid, if he were left there any time,
like all the rest.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” asked the governor
at once. “Explain.”</p>

<p>“I mean, sir, that whenever a prisoner is kept
any length of time in the dark, his loins are always
affected. It may be seen in their walk. Take the
case of Welsh. Welsh is quite crippled from being
so much in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Do they never recover it?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nihil was naturally much struck with this
observation, and gave it credence, thinking the officer’s
opinion worth attention, as he was particularly
shrewd and intelligent. But on consulting the
medical man of the establishment, he found the
statement quite without foundation. Nothing of
the kind ever happened; there was nothing the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
with Welsh, and never had been. It was all pure
nonsense.</p>

<p>Then there was the case of Stokes, a boy continually
in mischief, an arrant young villain, who coolly
tells the governor that it is no use sending him to
the dark&mdash;the dark only makes him worse. The
governor reminded him that he had often tried kind
and gentle methods in vain, and asked what would
make him better. Stokes replied that the only thing
to cure him would be a good sound flogging&mdash;knowing
full well that this it was not possible to
inflict except for certain offences, all of which he
studiously avoided. Three days later when liberated
from the dark, to which he had been sent in
default of corporal punishment, he tried a fresh
tack with Mr. Nihil, who observes, “This boy sent
for me, and spoke as from the very abyss of conscious
depravity. He complains of the hardness
and wickedness of his heart. He thinks there is
something wrong about him. He cried much. I
urged him to pray, but he said his heart was too
full&mdash;too full of wickedness to pray. I have
promised to visit him in his cell, when I shall
endeavour to soften and raise the tone of his mind,
and pray with him.” Of course his new attitude
is all hypocritical deceit. Almost the next day he
breaks out in conduct more disorderly than ever,
and after smashing his window, spends his time in
shouting to the prisoners below. The governor,
now alive to his real character, declares “that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
injury done to the discipline of the prison by the
perpetual insubordination of this boy has become
so serious, that I think he must be sent up to the
committee as incorrigible.” Again he wavers, and
again he changes his mind. “John Stokes applied
to me yesterday evening, and spoke so sensibly, with
such an appearance of a sincere desire for reformation,
that I must beg to suspend my recommendation
for his removal to the hulks. The result of such
removal would probably be to consign him to the
destroying influences of the worst companions.”
Stokes did not remain long in this way of thinking,
and continued still to be a thorn in the governor’s
side for many a month to come.</p>

<p>But we have in this an instance of the extreme
pains Mr. Nihil was at to do his duty conscientiously
by all. And if he had sometimes to deal with designing
hypocrites, he was not always wrong&mdash;at
least, in cases like the following, the imposture, if
any, was well concealed.</p>

<p>A woman came forward of her own accord to
confess that she had made a false charge against
another prisoner.</p>

<p>“What led you to make the charge?” (She had
accused the other of calling her names.)</p>

<p>“Spite.”</p>

<p>“And what leads you now to confess?”</p>

<p>“I was so much impressed by the sermon I heard
yesterday from the strange gentleman.”</p>

<p>The governor admitted that it was a most impressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
discourse, well calculated to awaken the
guilty conscience. “Being anxious,” he says, “to
foster every symptom of repentance, I did not
punish this woman. She freely acknowledged she
deserved to be punished, but I thought it might tend
to repress good feeling were I, under the circumstances,
to act with rigour.”</p>

<p>Another woman, named Alice Bradley, sent for
the governor, and told him that she had put down
her name for the sacrament, but that she could not
feel happy till she had told him all the truth. “I
encouraged her to make the communication,” says
the governor, “whereupon,” with a subdued voice
and many tears, she said, “I was guilty of what I
was sent here for.”</p>

<p>“This girl had invariably,” goes on Mr. Nihil,
“with much appearance of a tender conscience, and
a spirit wounded by injustice, protested her innocence.
This perseverance in her protestations had
now lasted six months, and it appeared that the girl
had imposed a persuasion of her innocence on her
nearest relations. I was much gratified with the
contrition that was now developed under the system
of this place, so consolatory amidst the numerous
instances of a contrary description which we daily
witness; and I endeavoured to trace the prisoner’s
impression to some distinct instrumentality, which
might be improved to further usefulness. She could
only attribute her recent feelings to prayer.”</p>

<p>Again, he states the case of George Cubitt, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
had been extremely well-conducted since he came to
the Penitentiary. “He looks ill, and much altered
within a short time, and seems much distressed. He
told me he had of late been affected with the most
dreadfully wicked thoughts, that he had a strong
temptation to sell himself to the devil, and feared
he had done so. That, on Friday week, when in
bed, he was much oppressed with these thoughts,
which he long resisted, but at last gave way, and
made an oath to himself to sell himself. He got up
immediately, and felt a chill all over him, as if his
nature was quite changed. Ever since he has been
subject to the most shocking thoughts and fears.
He attributed the calamity to his having been alone,
and seemed to dread the idea of returning to a cell
by himself. I see no signs of pretence about this
boy, and greatly pity him. His nerves have evidently
been shaken by confinement. I prayed with
him, and said what I could to dissipate his terrors,
and bade him make the goodness of God his protection.
I could wish that in a case of this kind
the discipline of the prison admitted of a little labour
in the garden; but I see great practical difficulties
in making practical arrangements for the purpose.”</p>

<p>Of course Mr. Nihil was in his element in dealing
with a case of this kind; just as the following
claimed at once the whole of his sympathy and attention.</p>

<p>A prisoner was seized suddenly with an attack
of hydrophobia. The only cause known was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
he had been badly bitten by a dog six or seven
years before. “The poor patient was in a most
distressing state, being a fine intelligent youth, and
in an admirable spirit of Christian resignation. He
observed to me repeatedly that he was a poor friendless
boy, and that this was a wise and merciful
providence, for if he lived to get his liberty he might
get into trouble and come to a bad end. When I
saw him next morning, most edifying was the whole
tenour of his observations and his prayers. That
night he grew to be in a state of high excitement,
continually imploring me and every one for tea,
while unable to taste a drop out of a basin which he
held in his hand. About midnight he took a turn&mdash;no
longer expressed any bodily want, but, as from
a mind stored with scriptural truths, poured out the
most appropriate ideas and expressions, though in
a raving and delirious manner. It was most gratifying
to observe the just views he exhibited, and the
expressions of his deep repentance and humility.
But dreadful to our feelings was the succeeding
phasis which his disorder assumed. He seemed to
struggle with a deadly foe, beating about his arms,
and striving with incessant violence, while he uttered
the language of abhorrence towards his enemy.
Then, after a while, he began to give utterance
to the most senselessly obscene and filthy language
and ideas, nor were we able to repress them;
but with these were mixed pleasing expressions of a
pious, confiding tendency. This mixed and incongruous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
exhibition continued till about 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, when
he sunk into death.”</p>

<p>Even if it could have been proved against Mr.
Nihil that he was lacking in the resolute peremptoriness
of persons bred to command, this chaplain-governor
was, however, not wanting in many of the
qualities of a good administrator. It must be recorded
to his credit that he brought in many reforms,
of which time has since proved the wisdom.
There was for instance the change he instituted in
the system of hearing and adjudicating upon charges
of misconduct. It had been the custom for the
governor to rush off post-haste to the scene of action,
and then and there administer justice. Now,
Mr. Nihil resolved to take “the reports” the same
hour every morning, “thereby economizing time,
and having the advantage of previous calm consideration.
Besides,” he says, “officers and prisoners
are both much irritated when the offence is
still fresh, and the frequent interruptions took the
governor often away from other subjects which at
the time had full possession of his mind.” Again,
after a daring and successful escape, he recommends
that every prisoner at night should be obliged to
put outside his cell gate all the tools, etc., with which
he has been at work during the day. An obvious
precaution, perhaps, which is the invariable rule now
with all men, especially “prison breakers,” but the
necessity of it was not recognized till Mr. Nihil
found it out. Although in his management of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
officers he erred somewhat in being too anxious to
obtain a standard of impossible morality, still he
knew that more than mere admonition was needed
to maintain order and obedience to the regulations.
With this in view he instituted a system of fines,
as the best method of insuring punctuality and exact
discharge of duties. It is really a marvel how the
Penitentiary had been governed for so long without
it. Nor did his tenderness and solicitude for
the spiritual welfare of the prisoners prevent his
entering a sound protest against over-much pampering
them in food. “I have frequent occasion to
observe,” he remarks in one part of his journal,
“the extreme sauciness of prisoners with regard to
their victuals. It appears from Mr. Chadwick’s
report, and the evidence that he collected, that the
industrious labourers are the worst fed; the next
best are the poor-house paupers; the next, convicts
for petty thefts; the best are felons, with the exception
of transports, who are still more abundantly
supplied abroad. The idle and the profligate act
upon the knowledge of these facts, and we have in
the Penitentiary several of that description. Their
fastidiousness and impertinence strangely illustrate
the fact that our diet is much too high for the purposes
of a prison.”</p>

<p>Certainly the calls upon his time were many and
various. Now for the first time, in consequence of
the great complaints made against the county gaols,
arising chiefly from the want of separate cells, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Penitentiary became the receptacle for soldiers sentenced
to imprisonment by court-martial. And with
the introduction of this new element he brought
about his ears a crowd of new questions and new
difficulties&mdash;a different dietary scale, different
labour, and a great accession of misconduct of a
new description; above all, new officials to deal
with, and plenty of punctilious red-tapism, to which,
as a civilian, he was altogether unaccustomed. Then,
through strong representations made to the Government
of the scandalous manner in which female
transports were shipped to the penal colonies, it was
decided that most of those who came from a distance
should be lodged in Millbank to await embarkation.
All these women were the scum of the
earth, and added greatly to the governor’s trials.
They came to the Penitentiary in a miserable state
of rags and wretchedness, shoeless, shiftless, and
filthy. They were often accompanied by their children
of all ages, from infancy to fourteen or fifteen
years; and in nearly every case the conduct of all
was violent and outrageous beyond description.
Knowing they had nothing to gain by a conformity
to the rules of the establishment, and that by no
possibility could they escape transportation, they
gave vent to their evil passions and set all authority
at defiance.</p>

<p>Another vexation, which pressed perhaps more
sorely on him than any I have described, was the
invasion of his territory by a Roman Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
clergyman, appointed under a recent Act of Parliament
to visit Roman Catholic prisoners. I do not
suppose that Mr. Nihil was more intolerant than
were others of his cloth in those days, when antagonism
between churches ran unusually high, and
there is much excuse for the remarks he makes on
the subject. By the Act provision was made for the
payment of the priest from the prison fund. This
Mr. Nihil characterizes as tantamount to “establishment.”
He does not see the necessity for anything
of the kind, especially as the scruples of all
the Roman Catholic prisoners have hitherto been
most punctiliously respected. He foresees trouble
and difficulty: Where was the line to be drawn with
respect to discipline? Would not friction and difficulty
arise from the Roman Catholic prisoners
placing themselves under the patronage of the
Roman Catholic priest in opposition to the governing
authority of the prison? Happily, these anticipations
proved almost groundless, and, except
in one or two trivial instances, which are hardly
worth recording, no evil results followed the occasional
admission of the priest to the Penitentiary.</p>

<h3>INGENIOUS ESCAPES</h3>

<p class="pch">The case of Pickard Smith&mdash;Sent repeatedly to the Penitentiary&mdash;Escapes
again and again&mdash;Best methods of
preventing escapes as seen in modern Prisons&mdash;Remarkable
case of Punch Howard&mdash;Escape ingeniously effected&mdash;Cleverly
recaptured&mdash;Jack Robinson at Dartmoor&mdash;George
Hackett at Pentonville.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most annoying of the many anxieties that
weighed upon Governor Nihil at this time was the
deportment of a certain Pickard Smith, who seemed
more than a match for all the authority of the place.
His case is interesting as an example of the length
to which a prisoner can go, even in times when better
influences were, it was hoped, at work with all.</p>

<p>On the day he arrived at the Penitentiary under
the name of Smith, it was discovered that he had
been there before as Pickard, when he was known
for notorious misconduct, though towards the end
of his sentence he had assumed an appearance of
reformation. On his recommittal he was at first
quiet and amenable to discipline, but he seemed to
have conceived suddenly a desire to be sent abroad
to the colonies. From henceforth his conduct was
detestable. At length he destroyed everything in
his cell: furniture, clothing, glass, books, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
“Bishop Green’s Discourses,” and then he endeavoured
to brain the officer who came to expostulate.
“If I am to go to the dark, I may as well go for
something,” he said; and after he was removed it
was found that he had written the following lines
on the back of his cell door:</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“London is the place where I was bred and born,<br />
Newgate has been too often my situation,<br />
The Penitentiary has been too often my dwelling-place,<br />
And New South Wales is my expectation.”</p>

<p class="pn1">Not a very high poetical flight, to which the governor-chaplain
remained insensible, and had the poet
forthwith flogged.</p>

<p>The magistrate came as before from the nearest
police office, for the express purpose of passing sentence.
Seventy-five lashes out of three hundred ordered
were inflicted, greatly to the benefit, it is recorded,
of other unruly prisoners, all of whom
were brought out to witness the punishment.
“They appeared much subdued in spirit,” says Mr.
Nihil, and for some days afterwards the prison exhibited
quite an altered character. But upon the
culprit himself the sentence had no effect whatever.
He spent his time from that day forth in whistling,
idleness, and impertinence, sometimes in his own
cell, oftener in the dark. His insolence grew more
and more insupportable; he told the governor to
hold his jaw, and his warder to go about his business.
One fine morning it was found that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
had gone. His cell was empty, and he had disappeared.</p>

<p>“The mode of escape,” said the governor in his
journal, “was most ingenious, daring, and masterly,
though the prisoner is only eighteen years of
age. There was a combination of sagacity, courage,
and ready resource, indicating extraordinary powers,
both mental and bodily.”</p>

<p>He had got, unknown to his officer, an iron pin
used for turning the handle of the ventilator of the
stove. The stove not being in use the handle was
not missed. The prisoner was let out of his cell by
himself, being kept apart from other prisoners in
consequence of frequent insubordination and the
mischievous tendency of his example. With this
pin he had made a hole in the brick arch which
formed the roof of his cell large enough to admit
his body. The iron pin, stuck into one of the slits
for ventilation in the wall, served as a hook, to
which he had probably suspended a small ladder,
ingeniously constructed of shreds of cotton and
coarse thread (it was found in the roof); and with
such assistance to his own activity and strength he
had got through the ceiling and into the roof, along
the interior of which he had proceeded some distance,
till he was able at length to break a hole in
the slates. But the battens to which the slates were
fastened were too narrow to let him through, so he
travelled on till he found others wider apart, and
here, making a second hole, he contrived to get out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
on to the roof. The descent was his next difficulty,
but he had provided for this by carrying with him a
number of suitable articles to assist him in his purpose.
It must be mentioned that he had chosen his
time well: not only were the officers later coming
in on Sunday mornings, but on Saturday evenings
the prisoners receive their clean clothes (their dirty
ones were not returned till next morning), so that
Smith had in his cell two sets of clothes&mdash;two
shirts, two pairs of long stockings, and two handkerchiefs.
He had washed his feet also on Saturday
night, and had been given a round towel to dry
them. Having torn his blankets and rugs into
strips, he had sewn them together by lengths, making
each, like the round towel, a link in a chain to
which his neckerchiefs and pocket-handkerchiefs,
similarly prepared, added further lengths. With all
of these, and attired in his clean shirt, he had ascended
as already described to the roof, where he
must have found his chain too short, for he had
added his shirt to the apparatus. This rope he
fastened to one of the rafters of the roof, and then
slung himself down to where he judged the attic
window was to be found, and he judged accurately.
The sill of the window formed the first stage, and to
its bars he fastened part of his chain, thus economizing
its length, instead of having one long rope
from the roof downwards. Descending in like
manner to the second window, he repeated the process,
and again to the third (or first floor), after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
which he reached the ground in safety. His next
difficulty was to scale the boundary wall. Much
work happened to be going on in the rebuilding of
parts destroyed by fire, and a quantity of masons’
and carpenters’ materials were lying about. First
he contrived to remove a long and prodigiously
heavy ladder (which two men ordinarily could not
carry), from against the scaffolding, and this he
dragged to the iron fence of the burial ground,
against which he rested it, but he could not rear it
the whole height of the boundary wall. Next he
got two planks, and lashing them firmly together
with a rope he picked up, he thus made an inclined
plane long enough to allow of his walking up it to
the top of the wall. Weighting one end with a
heavy stone, he easily got the planking on to the
wall and thus got over.</p>

<p>As soon as the escape was discovered immediate
search was made in all adjoining lurking-places.
Officers acquainted with Pickard’s haunts were
despatched to a far-off part of the town, information
was lodged at Bow Street, and a reward of £50 offered
by authority of the Secretary of State. He
was eventually recaptured through the connivance
of his relatives. Soon anonymous letters reached
the governor, offering to give the fugitive up for
the reward. A confidential officer was despatched
to a concerted place of meeting, and by the assistance
of the police, and his own friends, Pickard
Smith was secured and brought back to the Penitentiary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Mr. Nihil was much exercised in spirit
at his return. It appeared that he belonged to a
family which had all been transported. He came
to the Penitentiary himself as a boy, grew up in it
to manhood, and five months after his release was
again convicted and returned under a new name.
Mr. Nihil says: “Had it been known that the benevolent
system of the Penitentiary had been previously
tried in vain upon him, he would not probably
have been sent here a second time. It is plain
that he was not a fit subject for it, and his previous
experience within our walls, and probable acquaintance
with their exterior localities, acquired during
the interval of his freedom, rendered him a dangerous
inmate. After his flogging continued misconduct
rendered it necessary to keep him apart from
other prisoners&mdash;a circumstance which facilitated
those operations by which he lately accomplished
his escape. It is now highly dangerous to keep him
in the same ward with other prisoners, our means
of preventing intercourse being extremely inadequate.
On the other hand, conversant as he is with
the localities of the prison, aware of the aid to be
derived from the materials strewed about in consequence
of the extensive repairs after the late fire,
and flushed with his former success, it becomes no
less objectionable to place him apart where he may
be less liable to any interruption in any attempt he
may make. A man of his capabilities ought not to
be kept in a prison with so low a boundary wall as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
ours. I do not fear his escape, watched as he now
will be, but I fear his attempts.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though repeated efforts were made
to get this prisoner removed to the hulks or to some
other prison, the Secretary of State would not give
his consent. He said it would be considered discreditable
to the Penitentiary if prisoners were
transferred on account of its inability to secure them.
“Why not chain him heavily?” asks the Secretary
of State. “Why not?” replies Mr. Nihil. “Because
if he is prosecuted and receives an additional
sentence of three years, we cannot keep him all his
time in chains. The peculiarity of our system,”
goes on the governor, “hardly appears to be considered
as an objection to his continuance here.”
The principle of the Penitentiary was that it was not
merely a place of safe custody and punishment, but
a place of reformation; and, therefore, if it failed
of this latter object in any instance, a power was
reserved of sending away the prisoner as incorrigible,
for fear of his interfering with the progress of
the system among other prisoners. Next day he
was told he would have to remain three years extra
in the Penitentiary, whereupon he promised, of his
own accord, to abstain from making any further
attempts at escape, provided he were allowed to go
among the other prisoners. He was so much more
tractable and so much improved in temper that his
request was granted, and he was brought once more
under ordinary discipline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Having remained quiet for a month or more, just
to lull suspicion, he was again discovered&mdash;and
just in the nick of time&mdash;to be on the verge of a
second evasion. The window of his cell was found
to have the screws taken out, with other suspicious
symptoms. Smith declared that the state of his
window was the result of accident. He was removed
to another cell, and Mr. Nihil himself proceeded
to examine the one he had left. His hammock
when unlashed revealed the state of his rug
and blankets. They had been torn up into convenient
strips for scaling purposes. When the prisoner
was himself searched, between his stockings
and the soles of his feet were pieces of flannel, and
in one of them was a small piece of metal, ingeniously
formed into a kind of picklock. A piece of
iron, for this purpose no doubt, was missed from
one side of the cell window. He was placed in the
infirmary “strong room” for safety; then apart in
F gallery by day, sleeping at night in a small cell
below. But soon he destroyed everything in F gallery,
and then he was handcuffed. His next method
of disturbance was to make a violent noise by beating
with his handcuffs against the door; upon which
he was ordered to be removed to a dark cell, not for
punishment, but to prevent disturbance. Presently
a noise of loud hammering was heard in this same
dark cell. The officers on duty rushed to the spot,
and found that by some extraordinary contrivance
Smith had possessed himself of one of the staples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
by which the iron work was made fast on the back
of the door to the dark cell. By means of this instrument
he had worked away an iron grating fixed
for ventilation, and had been engaged making a
hole in the wall by which he would have soon escaped.
Smith was handcuffed and taken to another
cell.</p>

<p>The governor is almost bewildered, and begs the
committee to get rid of this prisoner. It would be
inexpedient to place him among other prisoners,
and yet that can hardly be avoided, owing to the
influx of both military and other prisoners. “As
to corporal punishment, he has already experienced
it very severely without any beneficial effect. His
knowledge of the localities, and the present unsafe
condition of the prison, owing to the extensive repairs,
will breed perpetual attempts, however unsuccessful,
to escape,” writes the governor.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Smith asked to be relieved from
his handcuffs. “What’s the good of keeping them
on me?” he said, “I can always get ’em off with
an hour’s work.” He was told they would be
fastened behind his back. “I can slip them in
front; you know that,” he replied.</p>

<p>“I threatened, then,” says Mr. Nihil, “to fetter
his arms as well as his hands, and that seemed to
baffle him. To-day I held a long conversation with
him, and cannot but lament that the powerful qualities
he possesses should have been so greatly perverted.
He spoke with great candour of his former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
courses. He exhibited an affectation of religious
impressions, though he acknowledged much of the
evil of his character. By and by I asked him if he
wished to have the handcuffs taken off. He did,
much, because they made him feel so cold.</p>

<p>“‘Will you promise if I take them off not to
attempt to escape?’</p>

<p>“‘I’ll never make another promise as long as I
am here. I have made one too many, and I am
ashamed of myself for having broken it.’</p>

<p>“‘What am I to do with you? Where am I to
send you?’</p>

<p>“‘It’s no use sending me anywhere, sir. If you
let me go among the other prisoners I am satisfied;
from what I know of the place, there isn’t a part
from which I couldn’t escape.’”</p>

<p>But Pickard Smith cannot remain forever in the
dark. Exercise in the open air becomes necessary,
and the first time he is taken out is in a dense fog.
Almost at once he eludes his officer’s observation,
and, slipping off his shoes, clambers up a low projecting
wall that communicates with the boundary
wall of the yard, mounts it, jumps over on the other
side, and runs for the infirmary staircase where he
hopes to hide. Fortunately the taskmaster, coming
out of the tower, catches sight of his legs disappearing
through the door, and running after him captures
him on the stairs. The fellow was quite incorrigible.
Again he goes to the dark, again and
again is he released and recommitted, till at length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
his health breaks down. If in the end he was tamed,
it was of his own failure of strength, and not of
the discipline of the place. I believe he died in the
Penitentiary a year or two later, but I have been
unable to find any authentic record of the fact.</p>

<p>I have lingered thus long over his story, which
is at best but sad and disheartening, because it is a
good illustration of the methods of coercion tried
in those days in the Penitentiary, and moreover it
opens up the whole question of escapes from prison.
Of course the convicted criminal shares with all
other captives an ever-present unsatisfied longing
to be free. Like a caged blackbird, or a rat in a
trap, the felon who has lost his liberty will certainly
escape whenever the opportunity is offered to him.
To leave gates ajar, or to withdraw a customary
guard, would supply a temptation as irresistible as
a bone to a hungry dog; and a prisoner’s faculties
are so sharp set by his confinement, that he sees
chances which are invisible to his gaolers. A resolute
and skilful man will brave all dangers, will exhibit
untold patience and ingenuity, will endure pain
and lengthened hardship, if he sees but a loophole
for escape in the end. The fiction of Edmond
Dantes and his famous escape from the Chateau
d’If, is but the embroidery of a poetical imagination
working upon a sober groundwork of fact. The
records of all ancient prisons contribute their quota
of similar legends, showing how the fugitive triumphed
over difficulties seemingly insurmountable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Baron Trenck’s escape from Spandau, and Casanova’s
from the Piombi, are as familiar to us as
household words.</p>

<p>In this present time escapes are of rarer occurrence,
and for many reasons. It is not that prisons
are really more secure <i>per se</i>:&mdash;so far as construction
can be depended upon, a gaol like Newgate
seems as safe as stone and iron can make it:&mdash;but
the principles of security are so much better realized
and understood. Our forefathers trusted to physical
means, and thought enough was done. To-day
our reliance is placed on the moral aid of continuous
supervision. An escapade like that of Pickard
Smith would be next to impossible now. He would
have been defeated with his own weapons. To compass
his ends a prisoner must have privacy; hours
of quiet undisturbed by the intrusive visit of a lynx-eyed
official, and a cell all to himself. He has now
the cell to himself&mdash;at least he has with him no
companion felon&mdash;but he is for ever tended by an
“old man of the mountain,” in the shape of his
warder, who is always with him&mdash;“turning him
over,” as the prison slang calls it; searching him,
that is to say, several times a day, both his person
and the cell he occupies. To conceal implements, to
carry on works like the removal of bricks, of flooring,
or of bars, is next to impossible, or feasible only
through a lack of vigilance for which the official in
fault would be called seriously to account. The
whole system as pursued in British Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
prisons even where prisoners work in the open air
miles beyond prison gates or boundary walls depends
on the close observance of certain principles
which have come to be regarded as axioms almost
with the officials. No prisoner is allowed to be
for one moment out of an officer’s sight; that officer
starts in the morning with a certain number
of convicts in charge: he must bring in the same
number on his return to the prison. Beyond the
vigilant eye of these officers in charge of small parties
ranges a wide cordon of warder-sentries, who
are raised on high platforms and have an uninterrupted
view around. A carefully prepared code of
signals serves to give immediate notice of escape.
A shrill note on the whistle, a single shot from a
sentry’s breechloader sounds the alarm&mdash;“A man
gone!” Next second, the whistles re-echo, shot
answers shot; the parties are assembled in the twinkling
of an eye, and a force of spare officers hasten
at once to the point from whence came the first note
of distress. It is next to impossible for the fugitive
to get away: if he runs for it he is chased; if he
goes to ground they dig him out; if he takes to
the water he is soon overhauled. The cases are few
and far between of successful evasion. In every
case the luck or the stratagem has been exceptional&mdash;as
when at Chatham a man was buried by his
comrades brick by brick beneath a heap, and interment
was completed before the man was missed; or
when at Dartmoor, another broke into the chaplain’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
house, stole clothes, food, and a good horse, on
which he rode triumphantly away.</p>

<p>At Millbank from first to last the escapes, successful
and unsuccessful, have been many and varied.
Pickard Smith’s was not the first nor the last.
The earliest on record occurred in April, 1831.
One night about 10 o’clock it was reported to the
governor that the rooms of three of the officers had
been entered and a quantity of wearing apparel
abstracted therefrom. Almost at the same moment
the sergeant patrol came in from the garden to say
that the patrol on duty in going his rounds had discovered
two men in the act of getting over the garden
wall by means of a white rope, made of a “cut
of cross-over.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Both men were on the rope, and
when it was shaken by the patrol they fell off and
back into the garden; but they attacked the officer,
knocked him down, and then ran off in an opposite
direction. The patrol, as soon as he could recover
himself, gave the alarm, and presently the governor,
chaplain, surgeon, steward, and a number of other
officers arrived on the spot. They separated in
parties to make search, while the governor took
possession of the cross-over cut, which was fastened
to the top of the wall by means of a large iron rake
twisted into a hook. This rake was used in the
ward for bringing out large cinders from the long
stove. It was thought at first that, in the patrol’s
absence when giving the alarm, the fugitives must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
have got over the wall; but the search was continued
in the dark, in and out of the tongues between
the pentagons, and through all the gardens. Just by
the external tower of Pentagon four, the governor
and chaplain, who were together, came upon two
men crouching in close under the wall. These were
two prisoners, named Alexander Wallie, the wardsman,
and Robert Thompson, the instructor of C
Ward, Pentagon five. Thompson said at once,
“You are gentlemen; we will surrender to you.
We will make no resistance.” But the governor
being immediately joined by the other officers, it
was as much as he could do to protect the prisoners
from attack and assault, as the former were
greatly excited. One of the prisoners was dressed
in a fustian frock and trousers belonging to Warder
Hay; the other had no coat, but a waistcoat and
trousers belonging to some other officer.</p>

<p>At the top of the tower in C Ward, Pentagon
five, out of one of the loopholes near the water
cistern, another cut of cross-over had been found
hanging, by which the prisoners had evidently descended.
On going up to the place there were found
close by, a large hammer, a chisel, and a screwdriver,
articles used in repairing the looms, and the
large poker belonging to the airing stoves. Several
bricks had been removed from one side of the loophole,
leaving a space wide enough for one person to
get through. To the iron bar in the centre of the
loophole one end of the cross-over was made fast;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the other reached the ground. The prisoners’ prison
clothing was close by this cistern, and in Wallie’s
pocket was a skeleton key made of pewter, which
opened many of the officers’ bedroom doors. The
prisoners confessed they had let themselves out of
their cells by means of false keys made of pewter,
and four of these were found near the place where
the prisoners had been caught crouching down.
The keys were partially buried into the ground.
There were two check-gate keys, one cell key, and
a skeleton key made of pewter.</p>

<p>Attempts at escape were not unknown in the
interval between this and the time when Pickard
Smith bewildered Mr. Nihil. But they were abortive
and hardly worth recounting. It was not till
years after the Reverend Governor had resigned his
command that serious efforts at evasion became
really frequent and successful. This was when Millbank
had become changed in constitution, and from
a Penitentiary had been made a depot for all convicts
awaiting transportation beyond the seas. I
shall have occasion to refer to this change in another
volume, but will so far anticipate as to include
in the present chapter some of the escapes that happened
later. The prison was filled to overflowing
with desperate characters; every hole and corner
was crammed; there had been no commensurate
increase of official staff, and therefore those indispensable
precautions by which only escapes could be
prevented were greatly neglected. Weak points are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
soon detected by the watchful prisoner, and in these
days every loophole of escape was quickly explored
and turned to account. That some of these convicts
were resolute in their determination to get free may
be believed when it is stated that one, <i>en route</i> from
Liverpool to Millbank, offered his escort a bribe of
£600 to allow him to escape. There was no doubt
that accomplices were close at hand ready to assist
him, but happily the virtuous officers resisted temptation.</p>

<p>One of the first attempts of those days was made
by a man named Cummings, who broke through the
ceiling of his cell. He traversed the roof of his
pentagon, but could get no further. Then he commenced
to sing and to shout, and by this he was
discovered. A ladder having been placed for him
to descend, he was secured. The prisoner himself
stated that he got through the arch by means of
a hole he made with a nail he had picked up in the
ward. The man was evidently cowed when he
found himself on the top of the Penitentiary, and
declared while they were trying to secure him that
he would throw himself down. He had made no
provision for his own descent; his rug, blanket,
towels, etc., were found in his cell untouched. He
had, however, traversed the roof along one side of
the pentagon.</p>

<p>Soon afterward seven prisoners made their escape
in a body from the prison. They were lodged
in a large room&mdash;afterward the officers’ mess&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
windows of which were without bars; and they
were able therefore to climb through them on to
the roof. They took their blankets with them, and
making a ladder, descended by it. The policeman
on duty outside roused the lodge-keeper, to say he
had seen a man scale the boundary wall between one
and two in the morning, by a heavy ladder reared
against the wall. All the officers were roused and
stationed round the prison; while close search was
made in the numerous gardens, stone-yards, etc.
At half-past four, two officers came back with four
prisoners in a cab. They had been tracked almost
from the walls of the prison and captured at Chiswick.
The other three were caught at Watford
by a recruiting-sergeant and an inspector of the
Hertfordshire police. They were on their way to
Two Waters.</p>

<p>Next day a conspiracy was detected among the
prisoners, who brought in coke from the garden,
to escape while so employed. Almost immediately
afterwards four other prisoners were caught in the
very act of escaping through the top of the cell they
occupied. They had broken away the lath and plaster
ceiling of the cell, removed the slate slab above
it, and had taken off the roof slate to a sufficient
extent to allow of easy egress; their sheets had been
torn up and were knotted together, and everything
was ready for their descent.</p>

<p>The next attempt, within a week or two, was
made by a prisoner who found that the mouth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the foul air shaft, to which his cell was adjacent,
was not protected by bars; accordingly he broke
through the wall of his cell, and having thus gained
access to the shaft, would have gained the roof easily
had his artifice not been discovered just in time.
Two others picked the lock leading to the garden,
meaning to escape in the evening; and just then by
chance it fell out that the prisoner bookbinders had
been long maturing a plan of escape. They had
made a large aperture in the floor of their cell, which
hole had been concealed by pasteboard. The whole
of the party (three in number) were privy to the
plot, and each descended in turn to the vault below
the cell, which was on the ground floor, to work
at the external wall of the prison. This, when their
plot was discovered, they had cut three parts
through. They had also prepared three suits of
clothing from their towels, and had hidden these
disguises beneath some rubbish in the vault, where
were also discovered a mason’s hammer, the blade
of a shears, and a cold chisel. A rope ladder had
also been made for scaling the boundary wall, but
it had been subsequently cut up as useless. The intending
fugitives thought of making a better ladder
from broom handles, to be supplied by a brush-maker
in an adjoining cell, who was also in the plot.
They had worked at night by candlelight. In this
case it is not too much to say that the officials in
charge of these prisoners were really much to blame.
Had they exercised only ordinary vigilance the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
scheme could not have remained so long undiscovered.
By the prisoners’ own confession the hole
had been in existence for more than three months,
and therefore the cell could never have been
searched.</p>

<p>But the most marvellous escape from Millbank
was effected in the winter of 1847, by a prisoner
named Howard, better known as Punch Howard.
He had been equally successful before both at Newgate
and Horsemonger Lane Gaol; but the ingenuity
and determination he displayed in this last affair
was quite beyond everything previously accomplished.</p>

<p>He was sentenced to transportation, and had only
been received a few days when he was removed to
a cell at the top of the infirmary, part of the room
called later on E Ward. The window in this cell
was long and narrow, running parallel to the floor
but at some height above it. The extreme length is
about three feet, the width but six inches and a half.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
It was closed by a window that revolved on a central
bar forming an axle. This bar was riveted into
the stone at each end of the window.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
In those days the prisoners used ordinary steel
knives, which were given them at meal times, and
then immediately removed. Howard at dinner-time
converted his knife into a rough saw, by hammering
the edge of the blade on the corner of his iron bedstead,
and with this sawed through one rivet, leaving
the window <i>in statu quo</i>. The whole thing was
effected within the dinner hour: saw made, bar cut,
and knife returned. No examination of the knife
could have been made, and so far luck favoured the
prisoner. As soon as the warders went off duty,
and the pentagon was left to one single officer as
patrol, Howard set to work. Hoisting himself
again to the window, by hanging his blanket on a
hammock hook in the wall just beneath, he removed
the window bodily&mdash;one rivet having been sawn
through, the other soon gave way. The way of
egress, such as it was, was now open&mdash;a narrow
slit three feet by six inches and a half. Howard was
a stoutly built man, with by no means a small head,
yet he managed to get this head through the opening.
Having accomplished this, no doubt after tremendous
pressure and much pain to himself, he
turned so as to lie on his back, and worked his
shoulders and arms out. He had previously put the
window with its central iron bar half in, half out
of the orifice, meaning to use it as a platform to
stand on, the weight of his body pressing down one
end while the other caught against the roof of the
opening, and so gave him a firm foothold. He had
also torn up his blankets and sheets in strips, and
tied them together, so as to form a long rope, one
end of which was fastened to his legs. He was
now half way out of the window, lying in a horizontal
position, with his arms free, his body nipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
about the centre by the narrow opening, his legs
still inside his cell. It was not difficult for him now
to draw out the rest of his body, and as soon as he
had length enough he threw himself up and caught
the coping-stone of the roof above. All this took
place on the top story, at a height of some thirty-five
feet from the ground. He was now outside the
wall, and standing on the outer end of the window
bar. To draw out the whole lengths of blanket and
sheeting rope, throw them on to the roof, and clamber
after, were his next exploits. He thereupon
descended into the garden below, which encircles
all of the buildings, and is itself surrounded by a
low boundary wall. This garden was patrolled by
six sentries, who divided the whole distance between
them. He could see them very plainly as he stood
on the roof between Pentagons three and four.
He took the descent by degrees, lowering himself
from the roof to a third floor window, and from
third floor to second, from second to first, and from
first to the ground itself. The back of the nearest
patrol just then was turned, and Howard’s descent
to <i>terra firma</i> was unobserved. Next moment he
was seen standing in his white shirt, but otherwise
naked, in among the tombstones of the Penitentiary
graveyard, which is just at this point. Concluding
he was a ghost, the sentry, as he afterwards admitted,
turned tail and ran, leaving the coast quite
clear. Howard was not slow to profit by the chance.
Some planks lay close by, one of which he raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
against the boundary wall, and walked up the incline
thus formed. Next moment he dropped down
on the far side and was free. His friends lived close
by the prison in Pye Street, Westminster, and within
a minute or two he was in his mother’s house, got
food and clothing, and again made off for the country.</p>

<p>Naturally the excitement in the prison on the following
morning was intense. Howard was gone,
and he could be tracked by his means of exit from
his cell to the roof, down the outer wall, across the
garden, and over the boundary wall. Here the trail
stopped; and though his home in Pye Street was
immediately searched, no one would confess to having
seen him. It was felt that recapture was almost
hopeless. It occurred, however, to Denis Power,
the warder of Howard’s ward, that this man had
come to prison with a “pal,” a certain Jerry Simcox,
who had been convicted at the same time and
for the same offence. Mr. Power thereupon visited
Simcox in his cell.</p>

<p>“So Punch has gone, sir?”</p>

<p>“How did you know that?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, you couldn’t keep him. We was in
Newgate together, him and me, and in Horsemonger
too; but we got out of both. There ain’t no
jail ’ll hold Punch Howard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you got out together, did you?” said the
officer, growing interested.</p>

<p>“Yes, and could again out of any ‘stir’ in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
three kingdoms, and they could not take us either.
We got to too safe a crib for that.”</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;?” Power spoke unconcernedly. If he
had appeared too anxious Simcox would have remained
silent.</p>

<p>“Punch has got an uncle down Uxbridge way
who works at some brick fields at West Drayton.
Six or eight hundred of them&mdash;Mr. Hearn’s lot,
they is. That’s where we went, and the police
daren’t follow us there. They don’t allow no ‘coppers’
on the premises thereabouts, Mr. Power.
That’s the place to hide.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” thought Mr. Power; “and Howard’s
gone there now.”</p>

<p>Within an hour he had obtained the governor’s
permission to go in pursuit, with a brace of pistols
in his pocket, and unlimited credit.</p>

<p>At the inn of West Drayton he bought from the
ostler a suit of navvy’s clothes, and went thus disguised
with a spade over his shoulder towards the
brickworks. The field was full and busy. There
was an alehouse close by, and it was early morning,
no one about but a sort of serving wench, a middle-aged
woman, one-eyed, and bearing on her face
the marks of a life of dissipation and rough
usage.</p>

<p>“Morrow, mistress. Any work going?” said
Power.</p>

<p>“Ah! work enough,” replied the woman, fixing
him with her one eye, which was as good as four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
or five in any other head. “But you don’t want no
work.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“No; I know you. You’re not what you seem.
That spade and them duds ain’t no sort of good.
You’re after work, but not that sort of work.”</p>

<p>Doubtful whether she meant to help or thwart
him, Power could only trust himself to order a pot
of ale.</p>

<p>“Have a drain, missus.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll help you too&mdash;no, not with the ale,
but to cop young Punch.”</p>

<p>“Punch?”</p>

<p>“Aye&mdash;Punch Howard. That’s the work
you’re after; and you shall get it too, or my name’s
not Martha Jonas. This three-and-twenty years
I’ve lived with his uncle, Dan Cockett, man and
wife, though no parson blessed us. Three-and-twenty
I slaved and bore with the mean white-faced
hound, and now he leaves me for a younger woman,
and I am brought to this. Help you!&mdash;by the
great powers, I’d put a knife in Dan Cockett too.”</p>

<p>“And how am I to take him?”</p>

<p>“Not by daylight. Bless you, if you went into
that field they’d never let you out alive. Why, no
bobby durst go there, nor yet a dozen together.”</p>

<p>“Is Punch Howard in the field with them?”</p>

<p>“There; look yonder. D’ye see that lad in the
striped shirt and blue belcher tie, blue and big white
spots? Can’t you tell him a mile off?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Sure enough it was Punch Howard, standing by
a brick “table,” at which a number of others were
at work, smoothing and finishing the bricks, or coming
and going with the bearing-off barrows.</p>

<p>“Come to-night, master. They sleep mostly out
there, on top of the brick stacks&mdash;and heavy sleep,
for the beer in this house isn’t water. Come with a
bobby or two, and look them all over. Punch’ll be
among them, and you’ll be able to steal him away
before the rest awake.”</p>

<p>So Power went back to the village, interviewed
the superintendent of police, kept quiet during the
rest of the day, and that night came in force to
draw his covert. Stealthily they searched it from
end to end. Among all the villainous faces into
which they peered there was not one that bore the
least resemblance to Punch Howard. Had the
woman played him false? Power could hardly
make up his mind to distrust her, so earnest and
embittered had been her language against Dan
Cockett. No doubt another night he would have
more success. Meanwhile time pressed, and he resolved
to try a plan of his own.</p>

<p>“Have you a good horse and four-wheeled
shay?” he asked of his landlord next morning.</p>

<p>“The best in all England.”</p>

<p>“Every man’s goose is a swan,” thought Power.
“Let’s see the nag.”</p>

<p>He was a good one, and no mistake; but an out-and-out
good one was wanted for the job in hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>At one end of the brick field&mdash;a spacious place
covering two or three hundred acres&mdash;was an office
for the time-keeper and foreman of the works. He
was an old police sergeant, long pensioned off, but
he had his wits about him still. The office was approached
by a narrow lane, with room for one set
of wheels only, a quarter of a mile in length, and
branching off from the high road to Uxbridge. Up
this lane, half hidden by the hedge, Mr. Power
drove to the foreman’s shed. The ex-sergeant was
alone, and readily fell in with the plan proposed.
“Here!” he cried to a young fellow who went
his errands and assisted in the office; “run up
to the field and ask Dan Cockett if he wants a
job for that idle young nephew. I see he’s back
in these parts. I need a lad to screen coal dust,
and I’ll give him twelve shillings a week. Look
sharp!”</p>

<p>The messenger went off immediately.</p>

<p>“A job for my nephew?” said old Dan. “Ay&mdash;heartily
thank you too, master. You’re a gentleman.
Hi! Punch, you’re in luck. They say
they’ll take you on. Twelve shillings a week. Run
along with the master: they want to ‘book you’ at
the office.”</p>

<p>So unsuspecting Punch accompanied the other
back to where Power was waiting for his prey.
This warder was an extremely powerful man&mdash;tall,
with tremendous shoulders, and just then in the
prime of life and activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>He stepped forward at once.</p>

<p>“What, Punch! What are you doing in these
parts?”</p>

<p>“I’ll swear I never saw you in all&mdash;“ He never
finished those words. His captor was on him and
had him fast. In less time than it takes to describe,
the handcuffs were locked upon his wrists, and, taking
him up in his arms, Power fairly lifted him off
the ground and carried him into the chaise. Without
losing his hold he took his seat too, gave reins
to the horse, and started off at a hand gallop down
the lane. He had the reins in one hand, the other
arm tightly bound round Howard’s neck, and the
hand used as far as it was possible as a gag. But
though it was possible to hold this captive tight, it
was not so easy to keep him silent. Before they had
gone a dozen yards Howard had managed to send
off more than one yell of distress, as a signal to his
friends in the field. The sight of the galloping
horse, the burly figure of the driver, and the lad
crouching close by his side&mdash;all three betrayed the
plot. Almost simultaneously several hundred men
dropped work and gave chase&mdash;some down the
lane, others trying to head the trap at the junction
with the high road. Power had his hands full:
in one, a struggling criminal, desperate, ready to
fling himself out of the chaise at any risk; in the
other a bunch of reins and a whip. However, he
had the start and advantage of his pursuers. Once
only was his escape in doubt: on reaching the road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the horse tried to turn sharp to the left, back to his
stable at West Drayton, instead of to the right to
Uxbridge. With a jerk that almost upset the trap,
Power turned the horse in the right direction, and
half an hour afterwards had left his pursuers miles
behind, and was safe at the police station. Within
forty-eight hours of his escape Punch Howard was
back in a Millbank cell, and Mr. Power was handsomely
rewarded for the remarkable pluck and
energy he had displayed.</p>

<p>A similar feat to Punch Howard’s was accomplished
by a man named Jack Robinson, at Dartmoor.
This man had long pretended to be weak-minded,
and had thus put his keepers off their guard.
He was in the habit of exercising himself shoeless
and bare-headed, and wearing an old hat without
a brim. In his bosom he carried generally a few
tame rats, which issued forth now and then to walk
over his arms and shoulders, and to lick his hands
and face. A frequent joke with Robinson was to
tell the chaplain that he had put his feet too far
through his trousers&mdash;which caused infinite amusement
always to his convict audience. Jack, however,
was fond of foretelling that he meant to make
April fools of every one&mdash;and so in effect he did.
One morning he had flown, and with him two companions.
He had cut through the bars of his cell
by some artful contrivance; which still remains a
mystery to this day. Some think he used a watchspring,
others some chemical process. He was not
recaptured, but later was re-convicted for stealing
a railway rug.</p>

         <p class="cap2">When transportation beyond the seas was discontinued, the
old war prison at Dartmoor, long disused, was repaired by
convict labor and became one of the best examples of the
modern penitentiary idea. The convicts have reclaimed the
vast tract of barren moorland, and in its place to-day are
broad acres of fertile farm and pasture land.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>No account of escapes from prison would be complete
without some reference to George Hackett,
who escaped from Pentonville in a manner nearly
marvellous. Through some neglect he had been allowed
to take his sheets and bedrope into chapel with
him. At that time the chapel was divided into a
number of small compartments, one for each prisoner.
Hackett worked unobserved in his, till he
had forced up the flooring, and so gained the gallery;
whence, by breaking a zinc ventilator, he
climbed through a window on to the parapet leading
to the governor’s house. This he entered, and stealing
some good clothes, changed, and so got clean
away. Soon afterwards he wrote the following letter
to the governor of Pentonville:</p>

<p class="p2">“George Hackett presents his compliments to the
Governor of the Model Prison, and begs to apprise
him of his happy escape from the gaol. He is in
excellent spirits, and assures the governor it would
be useless to pursue him. He is quite safe, and intends
in a few days to proceed to the continent to
recruit his health.”</p>

<p class="p2">Hackett was a very desperate man. He had already
escaped from a police cell at Marlborough
Street, when confined on a charge of burglary. The
cell was secured by two bolts and a patent Chubb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
lock. After his escape from Pentonville he remained
at large till the following Derby day. He
was then recognized going “down the road,” by a
police officer, who proceeded to arrest him, but met
with violent resistance. Hackett knocked down the
policeman with a life preserver and made off, but
was intercepted by a labouring man, who, though
badly mauled, succeeded in capturing him. Hackett
on all the charges was sentenced to fifteen years’
transportation.</p>

<p>A later escape from Millbank was that of three
prisoners on one Sunday, by working a hole in the
floor. They were located on the ground floor, and
having removed the ventilating plate which communicated
with a shaft, thus got down into a cellar
and so to a party wall with iron gratings. These
removed, they issued out into the garden, where, as
it was summer time, the thick vegetation concealed
them. By and by a gentleman passing gave the
alarm at the gate that he had seen two men climbing
over the boundary wall. Some officers immediately
gave chase, but the fugitives took a hansom and
drove off. Their pursuers followed in another cab,
and presently ran down their men somewhere near
St. Luke’s. The third prisoner was caught in
among the bushes of the garden, which he had
never left.</p>

<p>In this case the officers of the ward were very
seriously to blame. They were indeed suspected of
collusion, and without that it is difficult to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
how the prisoners could have effected their
purpose. They must have been long engaged in preparing
to make good their exit, and in the cellar
were found great quantities of weapons, tools, cards,
and other things.</p>

<h3>THE WOMEN’S WARDS</h3>

<p class="pch">Various outbreaks among the women&mdash;Drumming on the
doors&mdash;The dumb cell&mdash;What happened at Durham&mdash;The
Ladies’ Association&mdash;Greatest trouble from Convicts
in passage to the Antipodes&mdash;McCarthy&mdash;Anne
Williams&mdash;Julia Sinclair Newman’s extraordinary persistence

from Bethlehem as sane&mdash;Mr. Nihil’s vain attempts to
transfer her&mdash;No strait-waistcoat or means of restraint
will prevail&mdash;Finally transferred to Van Diemen’s Land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a well established fact in prison logistics that
the women are far worse than the men. When
given to misconduct they are far more persistent in
their evil ways, more outrageously violent, less
amenable to reason or reproof. For this there is
more than one explanation. No doubt when a
woman is really bad, when all the safeguards natural
and artificial with which she has been protected are
removed, further deterioration is sure to be rapid
and reform hopeless. Again, the means of coercion
in the case of female prisoners are necessarily limited.
While a prompt exhibition of force cannot
fail sooner or later to bring an offending male convict
to his senses, a woman continues her misconduct
unchecked, because such methods cannot be put
in practice against her. Although in some cases the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
men have made a temporarily successful fight against
discipline, in the long run they have been compelled
to succumb. On the other hand, there are instances
known of women who have maintained for months,
nay years, an unbroken warfare with authority, and
who have won the day in the end. Never beaten,
they continued till the day of their release to set
every one at defiance. That obstinacy which has
passed into a proverb against the sex, supported
them throughout, of course, coupled with a species
of hysterical mania, the natural outcome of the
highly strung nervous system.</p>

<p>A curious example of their strength of physical
endurance, and their almost indefatigable persistence
in wrong-doing deserves to be mentioned here,
though it occurred some years later on. A strange
fancy all at once seized a number of women occupying
adjoining cells to drum on their doors with the
soles of their feet. There is no evidence to show
when or how this desire first showed itself; but in
less than a week it had become general almost
throughout the female prison. To accomplish her
purpose a woman lay full length on her cell floor,
just the right distance from the door, and began.
She was immediately answered from the next cell,
whence the infection spread rapidly to the next, and
so on till the whole place was in an uproar. These
cell doors being badly hung, were a little loose; they
rattled, therefore, and shook, till the whole noise
became quite deafening and incredible. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
women were able to keep up the game for hours
together, day after day; in several cases it was
proved that they had drummed in this way for several
weeks. They soon worked themselves into a
state of uncontrollable excitement, amounting almost
to hysteria. After a time many became quite prostrate
and ill, and had to be taken to the infirmary for
treatment. The physical exertion required in the
operation was so great that women so employed for
barely an hour were found literally soaked in perspiration
from head to foot, and lying, without exaggeration,
in pools of moisture. In numbers the
kicking superinduced diseases of the feet, the whole
skin of the sole having been worn away; for it is
almost needless to observe that very early in the
affray shoes and stockings were altogether destroyed,
and it came to be a question of bare feet.
Several methods were tried to put an end to this
unpleasant practice&mdash;strait waistcoats, dietary
punishments, and so forth&mdash;but all without avail.
In that particular instance the disturbances continued
till the women had fairly worn themselves
out.</p>

<p>Later outbreaks of a similar character were met
and subdued in an altogether different fashion. The
introduction of “ankle straps,” which confine the
feet as handcuffs do the wrist, was found a highly
efficacious treatment&mdash;this, and the invention of
the “dumb cell.” From the latter no sound can
possibly proceed; however loud and boisterous the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
outcry within, outside not a whisper is heard. When
women feel that they are shouting and wasting their
breath all to no purpose, they straightway succumb.
But even more has since then been accomplished
by purely moral methods than by these physical
restraints. It has been found that the simplest
way to tame women thus bent upon misconduct is
to take no notice of them at all. When a woman
discovers that she ceases to attract attention by her
violence, she alters her line of conduct, and seeks to
attain her ends by other and more agreeable means.
The most potent temptation with them is the desire
to “show off” before their companions. A curious
sort of vanity urges them on. It is all bravado.
Hence we find that when these tremendous “breakings
out,” as they are termed in prison parlance,
occur, they originate almost entirely among the
women who are associated, in other words, who are
free to come and go and communicate with one another.
Separate them, keep them as much as possible
apart and alone, and you remove at once the
strong temptation to gain an unenviable notoriety at
the expense of the discipline of the establishment.
This was proved by the experience of later years.
Thus at Millbank in 1874 there were only three
instances of this sort of misconduct, and in the previous
year only four.</p>

<p>Weakness in enforcing the rules, yielding too
readily to the women’s tantrums, and letting them
have their own way are soon taken advantage of by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the turbulent spirits in a gaol. I had a notable experience
of this much later in a northern prison,
when one of Her Majesty’s inspectors. The female
prison population in the north are a rough, headstrong
lot, very difficult to manage, and at that time
the chief matron was a timid person, who found it
pleasanter to give way than to drive, and, of course,
the warder staff took their tone from her. It transpired
afterwards that it was the custom to let the
prisoners who should have been in cellular separation
collect together in parties of four or more in one
of the large workrooms, where they could gossip
and idle their time away for hours together, never
doing a hand’s-turn of work, and thus persistently
breaking the regulations. I had a suspicion that the
female “side” was in bad order, and on one of my
visits&mdash;I never gave notice of them, but dropped
in always by surprise&mdash;I went immediately to
that part of the prison. The warder who answered
my bell and opened the door looked flurried at the
sight of me, and I passed in quickly, to find the
interior in some confusion. There was a scurrying
of feet, a jangle of excited voices, and a loud banging
of cell doors, clear indications that things were
not all right. If I had any doubt, it was removed
by the sight of the matron, who was stooping over
a trap-door that gave access to the heating-chamber
below, and pitifully entreating the women to “Come
up all of you and be good girls.” I guessed what
was wrong. It was the winter season, and the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
below warm and cosy, just where such women
would love to linger. There could be no doubt what
was happening, and stepping across hastily I added
my voice to the matron’s, bidding them peremptorily
to “come up.”</p>

<p>“Lord save us, it’s the major!” was the affrighted
reply. They knew my voice and obeyed,
creeping up the stairs one by one, till all, a dozen
nearly, stood ranged in a row before me, and I desired
the matron to take their names down, then to
lock up each woman in her own cell. Next moment
they were off, running for their lives in an entirely
opposite direction. With a suddenness that was
startling they broke away and made for the staircase,
and up it to the top story of the prison building,
above the highest ward, and into the close gallery
just under the roof, whence they could reach
the skylights and clamber out on to the slates. We
knew they had reached the upper air, for their
shouts were heard all over the prison, and they could
be seen from the yards below, from the neighbouring
streets indeed, dancing and performing wild
antics on the roof above. We were all greatly puzzled
how to deal with them. Persuasion was futile
and it would be both difficult and dangerous to climb
along the sloping roof, seize each woman in turn,
and drag her down. After much debate I decided
to leave them where they were&mdash;a “night out”
would cool their blood, and they could neither do
nor come to great harm in the alley under the roof,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to which they would no doubt return of their own
accord.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I sent to a friendly magistrate hard
by, begging him to meet me at the prison next day
early, for I wished to have recourse to his powers
of punishment, having none myself. I made other
preparations to deal with my mutineers, and, passing
on to an adjacent town, saw the Governor of the
prison there, requisitioned from him all his “figure-of-eight”
handcuffs, and carried them back with
me next morning in a bag. The situation remained
unchanged; the women were still under the roof,
but no longer had access to the slates, for by means
of a ladder the skylights had been reached and secured
from the outside. Then the male officers went
upstairs and, after a sharp scuffle, extracted the
women from the alley under the roof, and brought
them one by one to their cells. No sooner were they
incarcerated than the magistrate and I visited them,
and he ordered each woman to be handcuffed, as the
law permits when fears are entertained that she will
do herself or another mischief. There was never another
outbreak among the female prisoners there.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>But to return to Mr. Nihil. It appears that during
his reign the condition of the female pentagon was
always unsatisfactory. We find in his journal constant
reference to the want of discipline among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
female prisoners. Thus: “The behaviour of the
female pentagon is frightfully disorderly, calling for
vigorous and exemplary punishment. Women contract
the most intimate friendship with each other,
or the most deadly hatred.” The bickering, bad
feeling, and disputes were increasing. After inquiring
into one case, the governor observes, “Before
the afternoon was over the combatants had the
whole pentagon in an uproar. One smashed her windows
to bits, and so did the other. They had to be
taken to the dark; but Walters produced a knife, and
would have wounded the matron.” Again, “I had
to reprove strongly the taskmistress and warders
for the laxity of discipline prevalent therein.” Later
on, when the rules of greater seclusion came into
force, he again remarks, “On the female side there
is great laxity, no discipline, no attempt to enforce
non-intercourse. Instead of a rule by which each
individual would be thrown on her own reflections,
and secluded altogether, the female pentagon is in
fact a criminal nunnery, where the sisterhood are
linked together by a chain of sympathies and by
familiar and frequent communications.... Although,
to the ladies who visit them, the females
repeat Scripture and speak piously, the communications
which many of them carry on with each other
are congenial with their former vicious habits, their
minds being thus kept in a state at once the most
depraved and hypocritical.”</p>

<p>These ladies to whom the governor refers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
members of the celebrated “Ladies’ Association,”
headed by Mrs. Fry, whose long ministrations
among female convicts at Newgate have gained
them a world-wide reputation. Having undoubtedly
done excellent work where crying evils called for
reform, they were eager for fresh fields of labour.
Accordingly they came and tried their best. It
would be hardly fair to deny them all credit, or to
assert that, because the women continued ill-conditioned
throughout, the counsels and admonitions of
these ladies had altogether failed of effect. It is
obvious, however, from Mr. Nihil’s remarks, that
their services tended to produce hypocrisy rather
than real repentance. The fact was there was a
marked distinction between the work they had done
at Newgate and that to which they put their hands
in the Penitentiary. In this latter place the women
were really sedulously cared for; they had an abundance
of good food, clean cells, comfortable beds;
they bathed regularly; they had employment, books,
and the unceasing ministrations of a zealous chaplain.</p>

<p>Newgate, on the other hand, when first visited
by Mrs. Fry, was a perfect sink of abomination, rivalling
quite the worst pictures painted by Howard.
There could hardly have been a more terrible place
than the women’s side. All that Mrs. Fry and her
companions accomplished is now a matter of history.</p>

<p>But the condition of Millbank under Mr. Nihil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
was not that of Newgate and other prisons in 1816.
It could not be said the Penitentiary prisoners were
neglected. No fault could be found with their treatment
generally, or the measures taken to provide
for their spiritual needs. Long before the arrival
of the “Ladies’ Association” the religious instruction
of the female prisoners may be said to have
reached a point of saturation: the preaching and
praying, if I may say so, had been already a little
overdone. Hence it was that their advent deepened
only the outward hypocrisy and lip service, and was
productive of little good.</p>

<p>The most serious annoyance entailed upon the
governor of Millbank was the charge of female
transports awaiting transportation. None of these
were worse than a certain Julia Newman, who was
a Penitentiary prisoner, and whose case I shall describe
at some length, taking it as a type of the
whole.</p>

<p>But there were many others among the female
convicts who were also very desperate characters
indeed; such as the woman from Liverpool,
concerning whom the governor of the gaol wrote
to say that she was so desperate that he thought it
would be necessary to send her tied up in a sack.
Mary McCarthy, was another, who was brought in
handcuffs from Newgate, with a note to the effect
that she required the greatest attention. She had
several times attempted to strangle herself, and had
therefore been handcuffed day and night and constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
watched. “She is a most artful, designing
woman, and will succeed, if not well looked after,
in her attempts to destroy herself.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nihil found McCarthy submissive and tractable,
but after the above caution he thought it advisable
to continue the handcuffing, intending to
withdraw the restraint as soon as she abandoned her
intention to commit suicide. At the end of two days
she managed to rid herself of her handcuffs, having
very small wrists; but as she evinced no signs of
violence or intractability they were not replaced, the
governor thinking, from his experience with Newman,
that effectual and complete restraint was impossible
if the prisoner was determined. McCarthy
was, however, constantly watched, and for ten days
she remained quite quiet. On the 21st of October,
a fortnight after her admission, she begged her
warder, Mrs. West, to come into her cell and teach
her to stitch. Mrs. West did so readily, and all was
calm and peaceable for a while. Suddenly, without
giving Mrs. West a moment’s warning, McCarthy
stabbed her from behind, inflicting one severe wound
on the forehead and the other under the ear. She
appears to have used the utmost violence. Mrs.
West got up, streaming with blood, and made for the
cell door, which she bolted behind her, thus securing
the prisoner inside. Assistance was called at once,
but on going back to the cell McCarthy was found
on the floor insensible, with a big bruise on her
forehead. She continued in this kind of trance for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
twenty-four hours. It was a marvel to every one
how she had got the weapon, for in consequence of
her known suicidal tendencies she had been furnished
with neither knife or scissors. However, on returning
from exercise, as it was afterwards ascertained,
she had seen a knife lying on the floor in the passage,
and stooping, as if to pull up her shoe, had managed
to secrete the knife in her sleeve. So unprovoked
and murderous an attack, coupled with the previous
attempts at suicide, indicated a maniacal ferocity.
The succeeding trance corroborated the suspicions;
and although the prisoner had exhibited great art in
concealing her weapon, such cunning was not inconsistent
with mania. She had also attempted to
effect her escape by making a large hole in the ceiling
of her cell. Therefore, a well known physician, Dr.
Monro, was now sent for, and at once, on hearing
the whole story, certified the prisoner to be insane.
She was now in the infirmary, her feet and arms
bound to the bed by several ligatures. The surgeon
removed those on her arms, on which the governor
thought it prudent to put her into handcuffs. In
the night she was caught in the act of getting her
feet loose, and was evidently bent on some further
mischief. Thus baffled, she remained sullen for
some time, then sent for the governor and made a
clean breast of it, having been moved thereto by a
passage in one of the Psalms, which another prisoner
who watched her had been reading aloud. The
expression she noticed was about “going away like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
lost sheep.” She told the governor that while she
was in the trance she knew some gentlemen had
come to see her, and that one of them was a mad
doctor. “I don’t think doctors know much about
madness,” she added, “or they’d a’ understood me
better.” Mr. Nihil was now pretty sure that McCarthy
was no lunatic, but Dr. Monro and Dr. Wade
adhered to their former opinion, so she was removed
to Bethlehem.</p>

<p>Another woman, Ann Williams, who was received
from Bath, proved a very desperate character. The
governor of Bath gaol, who brought her up to London,
declared he had never had so much trouble with
any prisoner before. She also was determined to
make away with herself, and the first time left alone
she had jumped out of a window an immense height
from the ground. This country gaoler, on seeing
the cell to which she was destined in the Penitentiary,
protested that it would be highly dangerous to allow
her to have pewter pint, or spoon, or cell stool. The
moment her hands were loosened she would be sure
to thrust the spoon down her throat, or attack some
one with the stool. Even the sheets should be removed,
for she was capable of tearing them into
slips to make herself a halter. Directly she arrived
at Millbank she tried to dash her brains out by striking
her head violently against the wall&mdash;emulating
in this respect another prisoner for whom, some
years later, a special head-dress was provided, a sort
of Turkish cap padded at the top, merely to save her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
skull. Williams’ language was dreadful, and she
refused all food. The governor now suspected her
strongly of artifice, and the doctor recommended
that she should be punished with bread and water
diet. That night she grew extremely turbulent. She
was then tied down to her bedstead, and a sort of
gag, brought from Bath for McCarthy, used, which
was effective in curbing her rage. This gag was a
wide piece of strong leather, having perforated holes
to admit of breathing, but which completely silenced
her horrible and violent expressions. After starving
herself for four days she had still strength enough
left to get out of her handcuffs, and would have done
much mischief had not the other prisoners who were
watching her held her down by the hair. After
greasing her wrists it was found possible to replace
the handcuffs. This was another case in which it
was thought advisable to give the prisoner the
benefit of the doubt, and she was also removed to
Bedlam.</p>

<p>It was quite within possibility that in these two
cases madness was proved. But it is often difficult
to draw the line between madness and outrageous
misconduct; and the latter is sometimes persisted
in order to make good a pretence of deranged intellect.
Among the female prisoners there are numerous
instances of this&mdash;and as a matter of fact
among the males also. Cases of “trying it on,” or
“doing the barmy,” which are cant terms for feigning
lunacy, used at one time to be more frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
than they are now, when longer experience protects
prison physicians from deception.</p>

<p>The case of Julia St. Clair Newman&mdash;or Miss
Newman, as she was commonly called in the prison
and out&mdash;attracted considerable attention in its
time, becoming indeed the subject of frequent discussion
in Parliament, and being referred at length
to a Select Committee of the House of Lords. Inside
the walls Julia Newman was for many months
the centre of all interest; she was a thorn in the side
of all officials, visitors, governor, doctor, matrons,
and even of her fellow-prisoners. Apparently of
Creole origin&mdash;at least it was certain that she had
been born in one of the West India Islands&mdash;she
came home while still a child, and was educated at
a French boarding-school. When sixteen she returned
to Trinidad with her mother, remained there
a year or two, and again came to England to live on
an allowance made them by Julia’s guardian. But
whether this allowance was too small, or their natural
proclivities would not be repressed, they soon
got into bad ways. Repeatedly shifting houses, they
moved from one lodging to another, always in debt,
and not seldom under suspicion of swindling and
fraud. Three months in the King’s Bench was followed
by a lengthened sojourn in Whitecross Street
Gaol; then came more shady transactions, such mistakes
as pledging their landlady’s plate for their
own, making away with wearing apparel and furniture,
or absconding without payment of rent. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
length, having left the apartments of a certain Mrs.
Dobbs in a hurry, they packed up&mdash;quite by accident&mdash;in
one of their trunks a silver spoon, some
glasses, and a decanter, the property of the aforesaid
Mrs. Dobbs. For this they were arrested, and as
soon as they were in custody a second charge was
laid against them for stealing a ring from a woman
in the King’s Bench, which Julia indignantly denied,
declaring that she had picked it up in the pump yard&mdash;where
of course there were plenty of rings to be
had simply for the trouble of stooping. Naturally
the jury disbelieved the Newmans’ explanation of
both counts, and mother and daughter were found
guilty and sentenced to transportation.</p>

<p>They were evidently a pair of ordinary commonplace
habitual swindlers, deserving no special notice.
But their rumoured gentility gained for them a species
of misplaced sympathy; and they were excused
transportation, to be sent instead, for reformation,
to the Penitentiary, where they arrived on the 11th
March, 1837. Of the mother it will be sufficient to
say at once that she was an inoffensive tractable old
woman, who bore her punishment with patience, and
eventually died in prison. But Julia was cast in a
different mould. Under thirty,&mdash;according to her
own statement she was only nineteen,&mdash;full in figure,
and florid of complexion, possessed, as was
afterwards proved, of extraordinary physical
strength, she displayed, from the first moment almost,
an incorrigible perversity which made her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the end a perfect nuisance to the whole establishment.
There was something ladylike about her
when she was in a peaceable mood. Inexperienced
people would have called her a gentlewoman. Not
handsome or even good looking, but decidedly “interesting,”
the matrons said when questioned before
the Select Committee. She was accomplished: could
draw and paint, and was very musical; sang beautifully&mdash;and
certainly during her stay at Millbank
she gave plenty of proof of the strength and compass
of her voice; and with all this she was clever, designing,
and of course thoroughly unprincipled.</p>

<p>The day after her reception she endeavoured to
tamper with the wardswoman; seeking to obtain
paper and pencil “to write a letter to her mother.”
When taxed with this breach of rules, she declared
the wardswoman wanted to force the things upon
her. Then she was found to have cut a page out of
“The Prisoner’s Companion,” a book supplied to
all. Questioned privately, Newman with many expressions
of grief confessed her guilt. Mr. Nihil,
who was still quite in the dark as to her real character,
pardoned this offence. She was next charged
with an attempt to induce a fellow-prisoner to pass
on a message to her mother&mdash;the substance of which
was that the elder Newman was to impose upon the
chaplain by a hypocritical confession, in order to
obtain thus the daughter’s release, Julia promising
when free to contrive means by which the mother
should also be discharged. The “dark” became her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
lot for this, and to it she again returned the following
week, for refusing to clean out her cell. When
the governor reasoned with her, she merely said she
would be happy to pay some other prisoner to do it
for her. This second visit to the dark brought her
under the doctor’s notice, who ordered her to the
infirmary, as she declared she was too weak to walk
downstairs. Her face having grown quite pale and
ghastly, help was sent for, when it was discovered
that she had whitened it with chalk. She again
visited the dark, and when released began again to
communicate with her mother. Several “stiffs”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
were intercepted, in which she tried to persuade her
to smuggle a letter out to their solicitors. This discovery
led to a strict search of Julia’s cell and person,
when large quantities of writing paper were
found upon her, though “how she procured the
paper, or the pen, or how she manufactured the ink,
continued a mystery implying great laxity of supervision.”
Her anxiety to write thus checked in one
direction found vent in another: with the point of
her scissors she had scratched upon the whitewash
of her cell wall four verses of poetry. The words
were harmless, and as she asserted that she felt it a
severe restriction being kept apart, the governor admonished
her well for this offence.</p>

<p>This leniency was quite thrown away. A fresh
attempt at clandestine correspondence came to light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
within a week or two. Newman passed a letter at
chapel to Mary Ann Stickley, which was found in
the other’s bosom, the substance of it being that
Newman professed a great regard for Stickley, and
begged of her to excite the hatred of all the other
prisoners against Ware for her recent betrayal of
Newman. A second letter was picked up by Alice
Bradley in front of Newman’s cell, addressed to a
prisoner named Weedon, whom she abused in round
terms for making a false charge against the governor
to the effect that he had called her (Newman)
by some horrid epithet&mdash;“which she could <i>never</i>
believe of that good man.” Newman’s cell was again
searched, when an ink bottle was found in the hopper,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and some substitutes for pens. Her letters
were found replete with artifices respecting modes of
communication. Her next form of amusement was
to manufacture a big rag doll for herself, out of a
breadth of her petticoat. When this was discovered
Newman was at exercise walking in the yard, and
she heard that her cell was about to be thoroughly
searched. Whereupon she ran as fast as she could,
back to her ward, and endeavoured to prevent the
matrons from entering her cell. When searched
herself she resisted violently, but with the assistance
of the wardswoman some written papers were taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
from her, also some leaves from the blank part of
her prayer-book, also written over.</p>

<p>“I understand,” says the governor, “a most extraordinary
scene took place when the prisoner apprehended
a search. She rushed to the stove and
thrust certain papers into it, which but for the
promptitude of the wardswoman, who behaved
admirably, would soon have succeeded in putting
them beyond investigation. They were however
rescued, upon which she threw her arms round the
warder’s neck, kissed her vehemently, went on her
knees, supplicated concealment, tore her hair, and
by such passionate demonstrations evinced the great
importance she attached to the papers. The warder
wept, the taskmistress contributed her tears, the
wardswoman was overcome, but all stood faithful.
In the midst of the screaming and confusion came
the schoolmaster, who was also assailed with all the
tender importunities of the fair prisoner, but all in
vain.”</p>

<p>By this time the governor arrived upon the scene,
the officers partially recovered from their consternation,
and Newman, much less excited, was disposed
to make light of the document recently esteemed
so precious. She said it was only a copy;
the original had been torn up. “What is it then?”
“A paper from which my mother and I expect to
gain our liberty. It relates to a person who was the
cause of all our misfortunes.” On inspection it
proved to be a statement, or dying confession, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
one Mary Hewett, tending to exculpate the Newmans
at her own expense&mdash;probably a draft of
what Julia Newman wished Hewett to say.</p>

<p>Three days later Julia was reported to be in a
state of fury. Loud screaming proceeded from her
cell. “I found her in a most violent paroxysm of
rage,” says the governor. “It was most painful to
see it. Not genuine madness did she evince, but that
species of temporary frenzy to which an actress by
force of imagination and violent effort could attain.
Towards me she expressed the utmost abhorrence,
and slammed the door in my face. I sent for the
surgeon and some male officers, for her screams and
yells, her violence in tearing her hair, and knocking
her head against the wall, made it probable that forcible
restraint would be necessary.”</p>

<p>The surgeon did not wish to have her placed in a
dark cell, nor even in a strait waistcoat, and at his
recommendation she was taken to the infirmary and
put in a room by herself; but she was not removed
without a continuance of violent screaming, to the
disturbance of the whole place. Papers were found
in her cell, on one of which was written “a lampoon,
composed in doggerel verses, in which she vented the
bitterness of her revenge. I (Mr. Nihil) was the
principal object of her ridicule. It is melancholy to
see a young girl of talent and some attainments so
bent upon deception, and when foiled in her artifice
abandoning herself alternately to studied malice and
furious rage.” She remained in the infirmary for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
three days at the special wish of the surgeon, though
the governor wanted to have her back in her cell.
All the time she continued to feign insanity&mdash;a
clear imposture of which the doctors, the governor,
and the assistant chaplain were all convinced. The
governor visited her to endeavour to convince her
of the folly and hopelessness of this course; but the
moment she saw him she addressed him with the
most insulting expressions, and seizing a can full of
gruel threw it at his head. She was restrained
from further violence, but continued to use the most
outrageous exclamations, to the disturbance of the
whole prison. The surgeon now consented to have
her removed to a dark cell; and the governor remarks,
“I can account for her personal hostility to
myself thus. She has been defeated in several attempts
to carry on clandestine communications.
Until Monday last she cherished a hope of getting
back among the other prisoners, where she might
still prosecute her schemes; but on that day I again
refused her, and my refusal was such as it was hopeless
for her to try to alter it.” She continued in the
dark, amusing herself by singing songs of her own
composition, “too regular and too much studied for
the productions of a genuine mad-woman.” She
slept well, and ate all the bread they gave her. The
visitor, Mr. Crawford, saw her, and recommended
another medical opinion. Accordingly Mr. White,
the former surgeon to the establishment, was called
in, and stated that her madness was assumed, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
he recommended she still should be treated as a
patient.</p>

<p>Goaded at length by the continued annoyance, the
governor writes to the committee as follows: “I
submit that the case of Julia Newman calls for some
decisive proceeding. There has been time enough&mdash;eleven
days&mdash;to put to the test whether she is
mad in reality or only in pretence. She has contrived
to set all discipline at defiance, continually
singing so as to be heard in every part of the establishment.
Her conduct excites universal attention,
and furnishes an example of the grossest insubordination.
If the prisoner is mad, she ought forthwith
to be sent to a mad-house; if not, she ought to be
sent abroad as incorrigible. Yesterday she showed
a disposition to return to her senses, as if tired of the
effort of simulation, but did not know how to get
out of her assumed character. To-day she is as bad
as ever. No doubt in time she would come all right,
but in the meantime what is to be done with her?
I cannot venture to place her among other prisoners.
If she is to be kept apart the whole time of her imprisonment
(of which three and a half years are unexpired),
there is every reason to expect a constant
recurrence of violence and other modes of annoyance;
for she has no respect for authority, and after
assaulting the governor and counterfeiting madness
with impunity, she will be emboldened to act as she
likes. If put into a dark cell doubts as to her sanity
will arise, and perhaps her own self-abandonment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
violence may superinduce real madness, and then it
will be said that our system at the Penitentiary had
driven her out of her mind. She is far too dangerous
a character to be sent into a ward with other
prisoners. She has already tampered with eight or
ten other prisoners, perhaps more.”</p>

<p>There was no end to her deception. In one of the
papers taken from her she asserted that certain
property was secreted in a flower-pot, and buried in
a garden in Goswell Street, at the house of one Elderton.
The governor applied to Sir F. Roe, at Bow
Street, who said, “Newman has been before me
already. She was charged in an anonymous letter
with infanticide; but on investigation, I found the
letter was a malicious composition of this Mr. Elderton.
The letter contained many revolting particulars,
and charged Newman with the utmost barbarity.”
The letter was sent for and examined by Mr.
Nihil, who at once recognized the writing as Newman’s
own; and she had evidently written it with
the object of ruining Elderton’s character, and to
appear herself as the victim of a conspiracy. “So
wily, ingenious, clever, and unprincipled a deceiver
as this prisoner cannot, I submit, after all that has
passed, be placed amongst others without endangering
the subordination and discipline of the whole
ward; and unless the committee are prepared to
direct that she be kept altogether apart, I hope they
will bring the matter to a crisis and send her
abroad,” wrote the governor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>For a month this violence of demeanour continued.
She was found uniformly ungovernable. In
her cell, when searched at regular intervals, clandestine
writings were always discovered; in one of
which was a long and critical examination of the
character of the young Queen, who had just come to
the throne. Mr. Nihil began to despair. “Julia
Newman having continued her pretended madness
up to the present time, to the frequent disturbance of
the prison, and having committed innumerable
breaches of order, it became my duty to put a stop
to her proceedings,” he says.</p>

<p>There was no chance of getting rid of her by
transportation, as the last shipload of female convicts
for that season had sailed, and there would
be no other till the spring. “This being the case,
I thought it necessary to converse with the prisoner,
with a view of convincing her of the folly of carrying
on her attempts, and warning her of the consequence
of any further disturbance. I found her with
her head fantastically dressed, and other ridiculous
accompaniments. She would not hear me&mdash;darted
out of her cell&mdash;stopped her ears, and uttered several
violent exclamations. I made several attempts
at expostulation, but in vain, and therefore I sent
her to the dark.” The surgeon thought her madness
all deception. Again: “As my visits to Julia
Newman are only signals for violence, I have abstained
from visiting her in the dark, but inquired
into her demeanour from the surgeon. He said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
in his presence she affected to beat herself violently,
and passionately to wish for death. Afterwards, in
a manner very unlike a mad-woman, she said she
had been put into a dark cell, but it was a matter of
perfect indifference to her whether she was in a dark
or light cell. As the surgeon turned away she swore
at him violently.” Next day she hammered out her
drinking-cup quite flat; and when being locked up
for the night, asserted loudly that she was quite well,
singing and shouting violently. There was an obvious
effort of bravado in her madness. Still the
same report comes from the surgeon: “J. N. continues
her affected madness.” The governor sends
word he will let her out of the dark as soon as she
promises to behave herself; and then Miss Neave,
one of the lady visitors, goes to her by the governor’s
request, “in the hope that the conversation of
a lady, against whom she could have no prejudice,
might have a salutary effect.” It proved ineffectual.
The prisoner said she did not want to be preached
to; would not listen to a word from Miss Neave,
threw water at her, singing also, and shouting in a
most powerful voice, so as to baffle all her attempts.
Miss Neave was quite convinced the prisoner’s insanity
was feigned, and that she was only acting a
part. At length she was removed to a sleeping cell
in the infirmary for treatment, and here after a first
paroxysm of rage, in which she smashed a basin into
atoms, she assumed a timid aspect, and when spoken
to by the taskmistress, wept like a child. “In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
hope she might be a little softened,” says Mr. Nihil,
“I spoke to Miss Frazer, another of the visiting
ladies, who agreed to go to Newman, saying that
Julia had always received her with gentleness and
apparent pleasure. On this occasion, however, Newman
behaved with frightful violence, refusing to
have any visit, dashing her can upon the table, and
seeming as if she would strike Miss Frazer if she
could. She had already blackened her own eyes, and
she appeared so possessed by despair, that Miss
Frazer thought she might do herself some serious
injury, and that her hands should be secured.”</p>

<p>Two days later we read: “Julia Newman is worse
than ever. The doctors say she is not mad, at least
Dr. Monro did. Mr. Wade is doubtful.” The governor
himself was of opinion that she was only
carrying on a deep scheme: He says, “I suggested
to Mr. Wade, a day or two ago, that if any circumstance
had arisen to make it probable that she was
really deranged, we had better have another opinion,
and send her to Bedlam; but there does not seem
any ground for this step. But is the prisoner to
defy all authority, now that the doctor has removed
her from the dark to the infirmary? Certainly not.
I therefore called upon the doctor to report whether
there was any danger in subjecting her to fresh punishment
for fresh offences. The surgeon thinks
there would be considerable risk in sending her to
the dark cell on bread and water at present. Had I
received a different answer, I should have proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
forthwith to act upon the reports against her; but
the committee will see how I am situated. She is too
ill for punishment, and gets more violent and refractory
than ever. Her acts of misconduct are:
refusing to take her dinner, tearing up her prayer-book,
singing loudly all the fore-part of the evening,
and refusing her breakfast; grazing her nose, so
that her face presents the most frightful appearance;
asking for a can of water and then throwing it all
over the taskmistress.” No further steps are taken
at the moment, beyond providing a special strait
waistcoat to be used in case of emergency. But she
still continues in the infirmary. About 7 o’clock
that evening she is heard screaming loudly. After
some time the governor sends to ask the surgeon if
he was aware of it. Answer comes to say that he
is ill in bed. Second message (oh, cunning governor-chaplain!):
“Would it be objectionable to her
health to remove her to the dark?” Surgeon, asking
only to be left in peace, replies, “Nothing to
prevent her being placed anywhere.” This is all the
governor wants. Off she goes to the dark, where
she remains till she is reported to be singing as
loudly as ever in her cell, and won’t give up her rug.
Next she is found lying on her back, with a handkerchief
knotted tightly around her neck. As soon
as she was better, she uttered the following impromptu:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“What a pity hell’s gates are not kept by dame King,<br />
So surly a cur would let nobody in”&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Mrs. King being the infirmary warder. Then the
assistant chaplain visited her, and was treated with
the utmost insolence. She attacked Mrs. Dyett, another
matron, and knocked the candlestick out of her
hand, “triumphing at the same time at her exploit.
Upon this I ordered her to be confined in the strait
waistcoat made expressly for her under the directions
of the surgeon.” Some time after this the doctor
visits her, and finds she has not only rid herself
of the restraint, but she has also torn the waistcoat
and most of her own clothes to atoms. Nevertheless,
he thinks her so unwell that he removes her
again to the infirmary. From this, in the course
of a few days, she returns to her ward. The cell,
however, could not hold her, and she soon forced
her way out into the passage. Another new, and
much stronger strait waistcoat, specially constructed,
was now put on her by a couple of male officers.
Within an hour or two it was found slashed to ribbons,
and on a close search a pair of scissors were
discovered under her arm, accounting no doubt for
the destruction.</p>

<p>Her next offence is to slap a matron in the face.
Again the strait waistcoat is tried, this time a newer
and a still stronger one; but it is found too large
to be of any use, so the old method is resorted to
and she is sent to the dark instead. For a time she
appears tamed, and for quite a month she remains
quiet, though still “unconformable.” She is, however,
next reported for making three baskets from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the straw of her mattress and part of the leaves of
her Bible. She has written a long incoherent statement,
probably with a stocking needle for pen, and
some blood and water for ink. The warders when
questioned showed great lack of desire to perform
their duties. The truth is, the prisoner was very
difficult to deal with, and they were all more or less
afraid of her. “It is no wonder,” says the governor,
“that a person of her strength, violence, and mental
superiority, combined with reckless determination
and obstinacy, should inspire these terrors; and I
really cannot blame these officers. Without perpetually
searching her person, as well as her bedding, it
would be impossible to guard against the practices
just reported, but this would occasion perpetual disturbance,
leading to no good end, but doing much
mischief in the Penitentiary.” Convinced that Millbank’s
means of punishment are totally inadequate
to attain the end of reforming her, or compelling
obedience, the governor, to avoid constant worry,
was content to leave her quite to herself, keeping her
apart&mdash;in itself a heavy punishment&mdash;and restricting
her to bread and water when she broke the
rules.</p>

<p>Newman, however, would not consent to be forgotten.
Her next offence was to refuse to give out
her cell stool, and when the door was opened she
flung it with great violence at her warder’s head, but
the latter fortunately evaded the blow. The governor
and the male officers together repaired to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
spot in order to remove this most rebellious and
dangerous prisoner to the dark. Her subsequent
conduct was all of the same stamp. None but the
most prominent features admit of being reported,
her life here being in fact one continued system of
insult and contempt. “In the dark cell she levelled
her tin can at the surgeon, and the contents fell upon
the taskmistress; had either of them been struck
by the vessel it might have been of serious consequence.
Her cell has since been examined, and several
figures and other articles have been discovered.
They exhibit extraordinary resource and ingenuity,
unhappily directed to the flagitious purpose of destroying
property and manifesting contempt of authority.”</p>

<p>As soon as she went to the dark, the surgeon
recommended that she should be removed to the infirmary,
as she appeared much exhausted. “I
thought it necessary to remonstrate against this,”
says the governor, “as it appeared ill-timed lenity.
I am very reluctant to liberate the prisoner from
punishment for several reasons. Every fresh victory
which under the plea of ill-health she has
achieved, has been productive of increased insolence;
and I have often lamented to see her indulged with
arrowroot and similar niceties at the very time she
has been defying all authority. The female officers
entertain just apprehensions in waiting on her in the
usual manner when restored to a sleeping cell, and
with regard to the mode of punishing her on fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
offences I am quite perplexed. I might again send
her to the dark, again to be restored in an unsubdued
state to a sleeping cell, and so on continually, but
I am obliged to resort to male assistance, and this
I find by experience has a very injurious effect upon
the other female prisoners, many of whom take it
into their heads to brave all female authority, and
require the men to be sent for before they will submit.”
The governor thinks, “All prisoners whose
insubordinate spirit does not yield to the ordinary
method of treatment, should be reported as incorrigible
and removed.... The moral injury they do
to the residue by long continued examples of rebellion
is incalculable.”</p>

<p>The assistant chaplain reported on 12th December,
that he found Julia Newman exceedingly exhausted,
and that the news of a letter from Trinidad
to her mother failed to rouse her. She had only
eaten a little of the crust of her bread, and he was
alarmed as to the consequences which might follow
if she were allowed to remain longer in the dark cell.
Mr. Nihil was still firm. He says: “I remarked that
her exhaustion was owing not to confinement in a
dark cell, but to an obstinate refusal to eat her bread;
and that I could not compel her to eat; if she would
not eat unless humoured in this instance, she might
as well refuse to eat unless I let her out of the prison,
and that I should not be justified in complying from
apprehension of danger to her health thus wilfully
incurred. In like manner it seemed now as if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
chose to starve herself because she was not allowed
to throw stools at the heads of officers. But of
course I have no desire to keep her under punishment
a moment after she shows a disposition to
conform to the regulations and maintain that quietness
I am here to enforce.”</p>

<p>The surgeon was now sent for, and asked what
he thought. He was afraid it would be necessary
to remove her on the ground of safety, being persuaded
she would sacrifice her life sooner than
yield.</p>

<p>“If you think she cannot be kept under punishment
with safety, I must submit to your opinion,”
said the governor. “It is for you to determine that,
otherwise I must distinctly object; for the duties of
my office will not permit me to give in to her while
she continues insubordinate.”</p>

<p>“It’s not the dark cell,” replied the doctor, “that
constitutes her danger, but her persistent refusal to
eat so long as she is kept there.”</p>

<p>“Very well then,” said the governor; “you may
remove her. I cannot stand in the way and prevent
you from acting on your own judgment.”</p>

<p>The surgeon went, and in five minutes returned.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“There’s not much the matter with her yet. Directly
she saw me she began to sing and scream,
with a voice as loud as if she had lived always on
solid meat. She pelted me with bread&mdash;refused to
come and have her pulse felt&mdash;abused, insulted me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
in every way, and finally said she was just as well
in the dark as anywhere else.”</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it was decided to leave
her where she was for the present, especially as a
forcible removal might have created a general disturbance
in the prison.</p>

<p>The next step in the case was her removal to
Bethlehem Hospital as mad. But even this was
misconstrued; for when, in the February following
(1838), a discussion arose in the House of Lords
as to alleged ill-treatment of prisoners in the Penitentiary,
Newman’s case was mentioned as one in
which, on the other hand, culpable leniency had been
shown. Those who found fault declared that she had
been sent to an asylum, not because she was mad,
but because by birth a lady. The same people declared
that it was well known that she was not mad,
and that she never had been. The matrons at Bethlehem
knew this well, and had told her to her face
that she was only feigning; whereupon she ceased
to feign. Then as it was clear she was not mad,
it was equally clear that Bethlehem was not the place
for her.</p>

<p>Accordingly, she was returned to the Penitentiary;
and back she came, exhibiting throughout
the most sullen contempt, and persistently refusing
to open her lips. Directly she arrived she again began
her tricks. Deliberately insolent refusals to execute
the orders she received, and open contempt of
punishment, were the leading points on which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
differed with the authorities. Again the governor
urges on the committee that she may be removed by
transportation, she being, under existing circumstances,
both intractable and incorrigible. “If I
am to maintain discipline where she is, it must be by
entering perpetually into fresh and perplexing contests,
the outcome of which may be very awful as
respects the prisoner and exceedingly embarrassing
as respects the institution,” he writes. She next
pretends to wish to lay hands upon herself, and her
rug is found torn up and converted into a noose.
It was hanging to a peg in her cell, like a halter
ready for use. The authorities considered it advisable
therefore to place her in restraint, in a new
strait waistcoat which fitted close. In an hour or
two she had torn it all to pieces. The next proceeding
was to confine her hands in a very small pair of
handcuffs, and to pinion her arms with strong tape.
The waistcoat appearing to have been cut, she and
her cell were searched, but no knife or scissors could
be found, and only a piece of broken glass which she
must have used for the purpose. She soon afterwards
loosened the tape, and was then bound with
strong webbing to the bedstead. Next morning she
was found to have got rid of the handcuffs, had cut
the webbing to pieces, broken her windows, and destroyed
her bedding. One of the female warders
was therefore sent to a surgical instrument maker’s
to purchase some effectual instrument of restraint,
and returned with a muff-belt and handcuffs, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
united, and ingeniously contrived to defeat the struggles
of lunatics&mdash;quite a new invention. Before
long she completely destroyed the muff and got rid
of the handcuffs attached to it. She was next secured
to the wall by a stout chain.</p>

<p>An officer, Mrs. Drago, who visited her just now,
asked her why she should make such a figure of herself,
pretending to be mad too, when she wasn’t.
“I’ve been advised to do it by my solicitor. If I
can only get out, I’ll soon manage to get my mother
out. I’m a person of large fortune, and can make
it worth any one’s while to do me a good turn. Mrs.
Bryant used to, but she’s gone. That used to be my
larder, over there,”&mdash;pointing to the window blind.
Her evident object was to tamper with Mrs. Drago,
and this of itself gave evidence that she could not
be very mad.</p>

<p>The chain by which she was now confined was put
round her waist, passed through a ring in the wall,
and padlocked. “This security was of short duration,”
says the governor, “before morning she had
slipped through the chain. It was again placed on
her in a more effectual manner, under, instead of
outside her clothes.... As she had destroyed so
much of her bedding I ordered her to have no more
bedclothes. In the evening she made the most violent
demand for a blanket, and said she was dying
of cramp and cold.... As a matter of discipline I
thought it my duty to refuse the blanket unless ordered
by the surgeon. When she heard this she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
quite frightened the female officer with the frightful
and horrible imprecations she uttered.”</p>

<p>In consequence of her getting out of her chain the
manufacturer of restraints for the insane came to
devise some fresh expedient for confining her. He
made a pair of leather sleeves of extra strength, and
fitted them himself. They came up to her shoulders,
were strapped across, then also strapped round her
waist, and again below, fastening her hands close
to her side.</p>

<p>Next morning the taskmistress took the sleeves
to the governor. In the night Julia had extricated
herself from them, and then cut them into ribbons,
using a piece of glass she had secreted. A new strait
waistcoat was now made for her, and she was specially
measured by the manufacturer already mentioned;
but it could not be ready before the morning,
so she was left without restraint that night.
Many of the officials were afraid she would commit
suicide, but not Mr. Nihil. However, next morning
she was found with her clothes torn to rags, and
part tied tightly round her neck. As a measure of
precaution the new strait waistcoat was then put on,
after she had been first carefully searched. A strong
collar was also put round her neck to prevent her
biting at the waistcoat with her teeth. “I lament
exceedingly,” says Mr. Nihil, “the necessity of resorting
to such measures; but what is to be done
with this violent and obstinate girl?” Next morning
she was found to have got at the waistcoat with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
her teeth in spite of the collar, then one hand loose,
after which she relieved herself of the apparatus altogether.</p>

<p>She was now left free, while fresh devices were
sought to restrain her, but in the midst of it all
came an order for her removal to Van Diemen’s
Land, whither she was in a day or two conveyed in
the convict ship <i>Nautilus</i>. And here the curtain falls
upon her stormy life.</p>

<h3>THE MILLBANK CALENDAR</h3>

<p class="pch">Millbank as a depot for convicts sentenced to transportation&mdash;Identified
with a large proportion of the criminals of the
day&mdash;Notorious robbers who spent some period of their
sentence there&mdash;Burglars&mdash;Jewel robberies&mdash;The receivers
of stolen goods&mdash;Thieves at the Custom House&mdash;Great

robbers”&mdash;A famous receiver&mdash;The Police Officers’ gang&mdash;Some
female thieves&mdash;Alice Grey or “Brazil”&mdash;Emily

<p>For some time past Millbank had doubled its
uses; a penitentiary for reformation and a depot for
those awaiting transportation quickly beyond the
seas. It had ceased to receive only selected prisoners
and worked under the general system of secondary
punishment; and many of the most notorious
criminals of the day made it a temporary resting-place.
We have seen in previous chapters how
persistently turbulent were the inmates of the prison
and we shall better understand this by a survey of
the most prominent offenders of the time, and the
misdeeds for which they were in durance <i>en route</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
to penal exile. Criminal methods for the most part
remained unchanged or the same crimes flourished
under different names.</p>

<p>Although highway robbery was now nearly extinct,
and felonious outrages in the streets were rare,
thieves or depredators were by no means idle or unsuccessful.
Bigger “jobs” than ever were planned
and attempted, as in the burglary at Lambeth Palace,
when the thieves were fortunately disappointed, the
archbishop having, before he left town, sent his
plate-chests, eight in number, to the silversmith’s for
greater security. The jewellers were always a favourite
prey of the London thieves. Shops were
broken into, as when that of Grimaldi and Johnson,
in the Strand, was robbed of watches to the value
of £6,000. Where robbery with violence was intended,
the perpetrators had now to adopt various
shifts and contrivances to secure their victim. No
more curious instance of this ever occurred than the
assault made by one Howard upon a Mr. Mullay,
with intent to rob him. The latter had advertised,
offering a sum of £1,000 to any one who would
introduce him to some mercantile employment.
Howard replied, desiring Mr. Mullay to call upon
him in a house in Red Lion Square. Mr. Mullay
went, and a second interview was agreed upon, when
a third person, Mr. Owen, through whose interest
an appointment under Government was to be obtained
for Mullay, would be present. Mr. Mullay
called again, taking with him £500 in cash. Howard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
discovered this, and his manner was very suspicious;
there were weapons in the room&mdash;a long knife, a
heavy trap-ball bat, and a poker. Mr. Mullay became
alarmed, and as Mr. Owen did not appear,
withdrew; Howard, strange to say, making no attempt
to detain him; probably because Mullay promised
to return a few days later, and to bring more
money. On this renewed visit Mr. Owen was still
absent, and Mr. Mullay agreed to write him a note
from a copy Howard gave him. While thus engaged,
Howard thrust the poker into the fire. Mullay
protested, and then Howard, under the influence
of ungovernable rage, as it seemed, jumped up,
locked the door, and attacked Mullay violently with
the trap-ball bat and knife. Mullay defended himself,
and managed to break the knife, but not before
he had cut himself severely. A life and death struggle
ensued. Mullay cried “Murder!” Howard
swore he would finish him, but proved the weaker
of the two, and Mullay got him down on the floor.
By this time the neighbours were aroused, and several
people came to the scene of the affray. Howard
was secured, given into custody, and committed for
trial. The defence he set up was, that Mullay had
used epithets towards him while they were negotiating
a business matter, and that, being of an irritable
temper, he had struck Mullay, after which a violent
scuffle took place. It was, however, proved that
Howard was in needy circumstances, and that his
proposals to Mr. Mullay could only have originated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
in a desire to rob him. He was found guilty of an
assault with intent, and sentenced to transportation
for fourteen years.</p>

<p>At no period could thieves in London or elsewhere
have prospered had they been unable to dispose of
their ill-gotten goods. The trade of fence, or receiver,
therefore, is very nearly as old as the crimes
which it so obviously fostered. One of the most notorious,
and for a time most successful practitioners
in this illicit trade, passed through Newgate into
Millbank and beyond. The name of Ikey Solomons
was long remembered by thief and thief-taker. He
began as an itinerant street vendor at eight years of
age, at ten he passed bad money, at fourteen he was
a pickpocket and a “duffer,” or a seller of sham
goods. He early saw the profits in purchasing stolen
goods, but could not embark in it at first for want of
capital. He was taken up when still in his teens for
stealing a pocket-book, and was sentenced to transportation,
but did not get beyond the hulks at Chatham.
On his release an uncle, a slopseller in Chatham,
gave him a situation as “barker,” or salesman,
at which he realized £150 within a couple of years.
With this capital he returned to London and set up
as a fence. He had such great aptitude for business,
and such a thorough knowledge of the real value of
goods, that he was soon admitted to be one of the
best judges known of all kinds of property, from a
glass bottle to a five hundred guinea chronometer.
But he never paid more than a fixed price for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
articles of the same class, whatever their intrinsic
value. Thus, a watch was paid for as a watch,
whether it was of gold or silver; a piece of linen
as such, whether the stuff was coarse or fine. This
rule in dealing with stolen goods continues to this
day, and has made the fortune of many since Ikey.</p>

<p>Solomons also established a system of provincial
agency, by which stolen goods were passed on from
London to the seaports, and so abroad. Jewels were
re-set, diamonds re-faced; all marks by which other
articles might be identified, the selvages of linen, the
stamps on shoes, the number and names on watches,
were carefully removed or obliterated after the
goods passed out of his hands. On one occasion the
whole of the proceeds of a robbery from a boot shop
was traced to Solomons’; the owner came with the
police, and was morally convinced that it was his
property, but could not positively identify it, and
Ikey defied them to remove a single shoe. In the end
the injured bootmaker agreed to buy back his stolen
stock at the price Solomons had paid for it, and it
cost him about a hundred pounds to re-stock his shop
with his own goods.</p>

<p>As a general rule Ikey Solomons confined his purchases
to small articles, mostly of jewelry and plate,
which he kept concealed in a hiding-place with a
trap-door just under his bed. He lived in Rosemary
Lane, and sometimes he had as much as £20,000
worth of goods secreted on the premises. When his
trade was busiest he set up a second establishment, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the head of which, although he was married, he put
another lady, with whom he was on intimate terms.
The second house was in Lower Queen Street,
Islington, and he used it for some time as a depot for
valuables. But it was eventually discovered by Mrs.
Solomons, a very jealous wife, and this, with the
danger arising from an extensive robbery of watches
in Cheapside, in which Ikey was implicated as a receiver,
led him to think seriously of trying his fortunes
in another land. He was about to emigrate
to New South Wales, when he was arrested at
Islington and committed to Newgate on a charge
of receiving stolen goods. While thus incarcerated
he managed to escape from custody, but not actually
from gaol, by an ingenious contrivance which is
worth mentioning. He claimed to be admitted to
bail, and was taken from Newgate on a writ of
<i>habeas</i> before one of the judges sitting at Westminster.
He was conveyed in a coach driven by a
confederate, and under the escort of a couple of
turnkeys. Solomons, while waiting to appear in
court, persuaded the turnkeys to take him to a public-house,
where all might “refresh.” While there
he was joined by his wife and other friends. After
a short carouse the prisoner went into Westminster,
his case was heard, bail refused, and he was ordered
back to Newgate. But he once more persuaded the
turnkeys to pause at the public, where more liquor
was consumed. When the journey was resumed,
Mrs. Solomons accompanied her husband in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
coach. Half-way to Newgate she was taken with
a fit. One turnkey was stupidly drunk, and Ikey
persuaded the other, who was not much better, to let
the coach change and pass Petticoat Lane <i>en route</i>
to the gaol, where the suffering woman might be
handed over to her friends. On stopping at a door
in this low street, Ikey jumped out, ran into the
house, slamming the door behind him. He passed
through and out at the back, and was soon beyond
pursuit. By and by the turnkeys, sobered by their
loss, returned to Newgate alone, and pleaded in
excuse that they had been drugged.</p>

<p>Ikey left no traces, and the police could hear
nothing of him. He had in fact gone out of the
country, to Copenhagen, whence he passed on to
New York. There he devoted himself to the circulation
of forged notes. He was also anxious to
do business in watches, and begged his wife to send
him over a consignment of cheap “righteous”
watches, or such as had been honestly obtained, and
not “on the cross.” But Mrs. Solomons could not
resist the temptation to dabble in stolen goods, and
she was found shipping watches of the wrong category
to New York. For this she received a sentence
of fourteen years’ transportation, and was sent to
Van Diemen’s Land. Ikey joined her at Hobart
Town, where they set up a general shop, and soon
began to prosper. He was, however, recognized,
and ere long an order came out from home for his
arrest and transfer to England, which presently followed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and he again found himself an inmate of
Newgate, waiting trial as a receiver and a prison-breaker.
He was indicted on eight charges, two
only of which were substantiated, but on each of
them he received a sentence of seven years’ transportation.
At his own request he was reconveyed
to Hobart Town, where his son had been carrying
on the business. Whether Ikey was “assigned” to
his own family is not recorded, but no doubt he succeeded
to his own property when the term of servitude
had expired.</p>

<p>No doubt, on the removal of Ikey Solomons from
the scene, his mantle fell upon worthy successors.
There was an increase rather than an abatement in
jewel and bullion robberies in the years immediately
following, and the thieves seem to have had no difficulty
in disposing of their spoil. One of the largest
robberies of its class was that effected upon the Custom
House in the winter of 1834. A large amount
of specie was nearly always retained here in the department
of the receiver of fines. This was known
to some clerks in the office, who began to consider
how they might lay hands on a lot of cash. Being
inexperienced, they decided to call in the services of
a couple of professional housebreakers, Jordan and
Sullivan, who at once set to work in a business-like
way to obtain impressions of the keys of the strong
room and chest. But before committing themselves
to an attempt on the latter, it was of importance to
ascertain how much it usually contained. For this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
purpose Jordan waited on the receiver to make a
small payment, for which he tendered a fifty-pound
note. The chest was opened to give change, and a
heavy tray lifted out which plainly held some £4,000
in cash. Some difficulty then arose as to gaining
admission to the strong room, and it was arranged
that a man, May, another Custom House clerk,
should be introduced into the building, and secreted
there during the night to accomplish the robbery.
May was smuggled in through a window on the
esplanade behind an opened umbrella. When the
place was quite deserted he broke open the chest and
stole £4,700 in notes, with a quantity of gold and
some silver. He went out next morning with the
booty when the doors were re-opened, and attracted
no attention. The spoil was fairly divided; part of
the notes were disposed of to a travelling “receiver,”
who passed over to the Continent and there cashed
them easily.</p>

<p>This occurred in November 1834. The Custom
House officials were in a state of consternation, and
the police were unable at first to get on the track of
the thieves. While the excitement was still fresh, a
new robbery of diamonds was committed at a bonded
warehouse in the immediate neighbourhood, on Custom
House Quay. The jewels had belonged to a
Spanish countess recently deceased, who had sent
them to England for greater security on the outbreak
of the first Carlist war. At her death the
diamonds were divided between her four daughters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
but only half had been claimed, and at the time of
the robbery there were still £6,000 worth in the
warehouse. These were deposited in an iron chest
of great strength on the second floor. The thieves,
it was supposed, had secreted themselves in the warehouse
during business hours, and waited till night
to carry out their plans. Some ham sandwiches,
several cigar-ends, and two empty champagne bottles
were found on the premises next day, showing
how they had passed their time. They had had
serious work to get at the diamonds. It was necessary
to force one heavy door from its hinges, and
to cut through the thick panels of another. The lock
and fastenings of the chest were forced by means of
a “jack,” an instrument known to housebreakers,
which, if introduced into a keyhole, and worked like
a bit and brace, will soon destroy the strongest lock.
The thieves were satisfied with the diamonds; they
broke open other cases containing gold watches and
plate, but abstracted nothing.</p>

<p>The police were of opinion that these robberies
were both the work of the same hand. But it was
not until the autumn that they traced some of the
notes stolen from the Custom House to Jordan and
Sullivan. About this time also suspicion fell upon
Huey, one of the clerks, who was arrested soon
afterwards, and made a clean breast of the whole
affair. There was a hunt for the two well-known
housebreakers, who were eventually heard of at a
lodging in Kennington. But they at once made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
tracks, and took up their residence under assumed
names in a tavern in Bloomsbury. The police lost
all trace of them for some days, but at length Sullivan’s
brother was followed from the house in Kennington
to the above-mentioned tavern. Both the
thieves were now apprehended, but only a small portion
of the lost property was recovered, notwithstanding
a minute search through the room they had
occupied. After their arrest, Jordan’s wife and Sullivan’s
brother came to the inn, and begged to be
allowed to visit this room; but their request, in spite
of their earnest entreaties, was refused, at the instigation
of the police. A few days later a frequent
guest at the tavern arrived, and had this same room
allotted to him. A fire was lit in it, and the maid in
doing so threw a lot of rubbish, as it seemed, which
had accumulated under the grate, on top of the burning
coals. By and by the occupant of the room noticed
something glittering in the centre of the fire,
which, to inspect more closely, he took out with the
tongs. It was a large gold brooch set in pearls, but
a portion of the mounting had melted with the heat.
The fire was raked out, and in the ashes were found
seven large and four dozen small brilliants, also
seven emeralds, one of them of considerable size.
A part of the “swag” stolen from the bonded warehouse
was thus recovered, but it was supposed that
a number of the stolen notes had perished in the fire.</p>

<p>The condign punishment meted out to these Custom
House robbers had no deterrent effect seemingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Within three months, three new and most
mysterious burglaries were committed at the West
End, all in houses adjoining each other. One was
occupied by the Portuguese ambassador, who lost a
quantity of jewelry from an escritoire, and his
neighbours lost plate and cash. Not the slightest
clue to these large affairs was ever obtained, but it
is probable that they were “put up” jobs, or managed
with the complicity of servants. The next year
twelve thousand sovereigns were cleverly stolen in
the Mile End Road.</p>

<p>The gold-dust robbery of 1839, the first of its
kind, was cleverly and carefully planned with the
assistance of a dishonest employee. A young man
named Caspar, clerk to a steamship company,
learned through the firm’s correspondence that a
quantity of gold-dust brought in a man-of-war from
Brazil had been transhipped at Falmouth for conveyance
to London. The letter informed him of the
marks and sizes of the cases containing the precious
metal, and he with his father arranged that a messenger
should call for the stuff with forged credentials,
thus anticipating the rightful owner. The
fraudulent messenger, by the help of young Caspar,
established his claim to the boxes, paid the wharfage
dues, and carried off the gold-dust. Presently the
proper person arrived from the consignees, but
found the gold-dust gone. The police were at once
employed, and after infinite pains they discovered
the person, one Moss, who had acted as the messenger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Moss was known to be intimate with the elder
Caspar, father of the clerk to the steamship company,
and these facts were deemed sufficient to justify
the arrest of all three. They also ascertained
that a gold-refiner, Solomons, had sold bar gold to
the value of £1,200 to certain bullion dealers. Solomons
was not straightforward in his replies as to
where he got the gold, and he was soon placed in
the dock with the Caspars and Moss. Moss presently
turned approver, and implicated “Money
Moses,” another Jew, for the whole affair had been
planned and executed by members of the Hebrew
persuasion. “Money Moses” had received the
stolen gold-dust from Moss’ father-in-law, Davis,
or Isaacs, who was never arrested, and passed it on
to Solomons by his daughter, a widow named Abrahams.
Solomons was now also admitted as a witness,
and his evidence, with that of Moss, secured
the transportation of the principal actors in the theft.
In the course of the trial it came out that almost
every one concerned except the Caspars had endeavoured
to defraud his accomplices. Moss peached
because he declared he had been done out of the
proper price of the gold-dust; but it was clear that
he had tried to appropriate the whole of the stuff,
instead of handing it or the price of it back to the
Caspars. “Money Moses” and Mrs. Abrahams
imposed upon Moss as to the price paid by Solomons;
Mrs. Abrahams imposed upon her father by
abstracting a portion of the dust and selling it on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
her own account; Solomons cheated the whole lot
by retaining half the gold in his possession, and only
giving an I. O. U. for it, which he refused to redeem
on account of the row about the robbery.</p>

<p>Moses, it may be added, was a direct descendant
of the Ikey Solomons already mentioned. He was
ostensibly a publican, and kept the Black Lion in
Vinegar Yard, Drury Lane, where secretly he did
business as one of the most daring and successful
fencers ever known in the metropolis. His arrest
and conviction cast dismay over the whole gang of
receivers, and for a time seriously checked the nefarious
traffic. It may be added that prison life did
not agree with “Money Moses;” a striking change
came over his appearance while in prison. Before
his confinement he had been a sleek round person,
addicted obviously to the pleasures of the table. He
did not thrive on prison fare, now more strictly
meagre, thanks to the inspectors and the more
stringent discipline, and before he embarked for
Australia to undergo his fourteen years, he was
reported to have fallen away to a shadow.</p>

<p>As the century advanced crimes of fraud increased.
They were not only more numerous, but
on a wider scale. The most extensive and systematic
robberies were planned so ingeniously and carried
out so cleverly that they long escaped detection.
Among the earliest of the big operators in fraudulent
finance was Edward Beaumont Smith who
uttered false exchequer bills to an almost fabulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
amount. Another fraud greatly developed was the
wilful shipwreck and casting away of a ship which
with her cargo, real or imaginary, had been heavily
insured. The <i>Dryad</i> was a brig owned principally
by two persons named Wallace, one a seaman,
the other a merchant. She was freighted by the
firm of Zulueta and Co. for a voyage to Santa Cruz.
Her owners insured her for a full sum of £2,000,
after which the Wallaces insured her privily with
other underwriters for a second sum of £2,000.
After this, on the faith of forged bills of lading, the
captain, Loose by name, being a party to the intended
fraud, they obtained further insurances on
goods never shipped. It was fully proved in evidence
that when the <i>Dryad</i> sailed she carried
nothing but the cargo belonging to Zulueta and Co.
Yet the Wallaces pretended to have put on board
quantities of flannels, cloths, cotton prints, beef,
pork, butter, and earthenwares, on all of which they
effected insurances. Loose had his instructions to
cast away the ship on the first possible opportunity,
and from the time of his leaving Liverpool he acted
in a manner which excited the suspicions of the
crew. The larboard pump was suffered to remain
choked up, and the long-boat was fitted with tackles
and held ready for use at a moment’s notice. The
ship, however, met with exasperatingly fine weather,
and it was not until the captain reached the West
India Islands that he got a chance of accomplishing
his crime. At a place called the Silver Keys he ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the ship on the reef. But another ship, concluding
that he was acting in ignorance, rendered him assistance.
The <i>Dryad</i> was got off, repaired, and
her voyage renewed to Santa Cruz. He crept along
the coast close in shore, looking for a quiet spot to
cast away the ship, and at last, when within fifteen
miles of port, with wind and weather perfectly fair,
he ran her on to the rocks. Even then she might
have been saved, but the captain would not suffer
the crew to act. Nearly the whole of the cargo was
lost as well as the ship. The captain and crew, however,
got safely to Jamaica, and so to England, the
captain dying on the voyage home.</p>

<p>The crime soon became public. Mate, carpenter,
and crew were eager to disavow complicity, and
voluntarily gave information. The Wallaces were
arrested, committed to Newgate, and tried at the
Old Bailey. The case was clearly proved against
them, and both were sentenced to transportation for
life. While lying in Newgate, awaiting removal to
the convict ship, both prisoners made full confessions.
According to their own statements the loss
of the <i>Dryad</i> was only one of six intentional
shipwrecks with which they had been concerned.
The crime of fraudulent insurance they declared was
very common, and the underwriters must have lost
great sums in this way. The merchant Wallace
said he had been led into the crime by the advice
and example of a city friend who had gone largely
into this nefarious business; this Wallace added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
that his friend had made several voyages with the
distinct intention of superintending the predetermined
shipwrecks. The other Wallace, the sailor,
also traced his lapse into crime to evil counsel. He
was an honest sea-captain, he said, trading from
Liverpool, where once he had the misfortune to be
introduced to a man of wealth, the foundations of
which had been laid by buying old ships on purpose
to cast them away. This person made much of Wallace,
encouraged his attentions to his daughter, and
tempted him to take to fraudulent insurance as a
certain method of achieving fortune. Wallace’s relations
warned him against his Liverpool friend,
but he would not take their advice, and developing
his transactions, ended as we have seen.</p>

<p>A clergyman nearly a century later followed in
the steps of Dr. Dodd, but under more humane
laws did not lose his life. The Rev. W. Bailey,
LL. D., was convicted at the Central Criminal
Court, in February, 1843, of forgery. A notorious
miser, Robert Smith, had recently died in Seven
Dials, where he had amassed a considerable fortune.
But among the charges on the estate he left was a
promissory note for £2,875, produced by Dr. Bailey,
and purporting to be signed by Smith. The executors
to the estate disputed the validity of this document.
Miss Bailey, the doctor’s sister, in whose
favour the note was said to have been given, then
brought an action against the administrators, and at
the trial Dr. Bailey swore that the note had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
given him by Smith. The jury did not believe him,
and the verdict was for the defendants. Subsequently
Bailey was arrested on a charge of forgery,
and after a long trial found guilty. His sentence
was transportation for life.</p>

<p>A gigantic conspiracy to defraud was discovered
in the following year, when a solicitor named William
Henry Barber, Joshua Fletcher, a surgeon, and
three others were charged with forging wills for
the purpose of obtaining unclaimed stock in the
funds. There were two separate affairs. In the
first a maiden lady, Miss Slack, who was the possessor
of two separate sums in consols, neglected
through strange carelessness on her own part and
that of her friends to draw the dividends on more
than one sum. The other, remaining unclaimed for
ten years, was transferred at the end of that time
to the commissioners for the reduction of the National
Debt. Barber, it was said, became aware of
this, and he gained access to Miss Slack on pretence
of conveying to her some funded property left her
by an aunt. By this means her signature was obtained;
a forged will was prepared bequeathing the
unclaimed stock to Miss Slack; a note purporting
to be from Miss Slack was addressed to the governor
of the Bank of England, begging that the
said stock might be handed over to her, and a person
calling herself Miss Slack duly attended at the
bank, where the money was handed over to her in
proper form. A second will, also forged, was propounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
at Doctors’ Commons as that of a Mrs.
Hunt of Bristol. Mrs. Hunt had left money in the
funds which remained unclaimed, and had been
transferred, as in Miss Slack’s case. Here again the
money, with ten years’ interest, was handed over to
Barber and another calling himself Thomas Hunt,
an executor of the will. It was shown that the will
must be a forgery, as its signature was dated 1829,
whereas Mrs. Hunt actually died in 1806. A third
similar fraud to the amount of £2,000 was also
brought to light. Fletcher was the moving spirit of
the whole business. It was he who had introduced
Barber to Miss Slack, and held all the threads of
these intricate and nefarious transactions. Barber
and Fletcher were both transported for life, although
Fletcher declared that Barber was innocent,
and had no guilty knowledge of what was being
done. Barber was subsequently pardoned, but was
not replaced on the rolls as an attorney till 1855,
when Lord Campbell delivered judgment on Barber’s
petition, to the effect that “the evidence to
establish his (Barber’s) connivance in the frauds
was too doubtful for us to continue his exclusion
any longer.”</p>

<p>Foremost on the Millbank calendar stand those
of the upper classes, who were afterwards styled in
Australia, “specials,” or “gentlemen convicts.” It
was said that of these there were at one and the
same time in Millbank two captains, a baronet, four
clergymen, a solicitor, and one or two doctors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
medicine. The tradition is <i>ben trovato</i>, if not exactly
true. Of course in such a prison there would
be representatives of every class, and although the
percentage of gentlemen who commit crimes is in
the long run far below that of the middle or lower
classes, there is no special natural law by which the
blue blood is exempted from the ordinary weakness
and imperfections of humanity. Most of these genteel
people who found themselves in Millbank owed
their fate to forgery or fraud. There was the old
gentleman of seventy years of age, who had been a
mayor in a north-country manufacturing town, and
who had forged and defrauded his nieces out of
some £360,000. The officers spoke of him as “a
fine old fellow,” who took to his new task of tailoring
like a man, and who could soon turn out a
soldier’s great-coat as well as any one in the prison.
Another convict of this stamp was Mr. T., a Liverpool
merchant in a prosperous business, who was
a forger on quite a colossal scale. It was proved at
his trial that he had forged thirty bills of exchange,
amounting to a total of £32,811, and that he had a
guilty knowledge of one hundred and fifteen other
bills, which were valued in all at £133,000. In his
defence it was urged that he had taken up many
bills before they were due, and would undoubtedly
have taken up all had not the discovery of one forgery
exposed his frauds and put an end suddenly
to his business. Still, said his counsel, his estate
could have paid from twelve to fifteen shillings in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the pound, and it could hardly be maintained against
him that he had any moral intention of defrauding.
Judge Talfourd appears to have commented
strongly, in summing up, upon such an idea of
morality as this; and then and there sentenced Mr.
T. to transportation for life. Unfortunately for the
criminal himself, his sentence came a little too late:
had he gone out to New South Wales twenty years
earlier, with his commercial aptitude and generally
unscrupulous plan of action, he would have run well
to the front in the race for wealth amidst his felon
competitors.</p>

<p>More contemptible, but not less atrocious, was
the conduct of Mr. B., who had taken his diploma
as surgeon, and practised as such in many parts of
the country. His offence was bigamy on a large
scale: he was guilty of a series of heartless deceptions,
so that it was said the scene in court when
this Blue Beard was finally arraigned, and all his
victims appeared against him, was painful in the
extreme. He was brought to book by the friend of
a young lady to whom he was trying to pay his
attentions. This gentleman, being somewhat suspicious,
made inquiries, and discovered enough to
have him arrested. Four different certificates of
marriage were put in evidence. It seemed that,
although already married in Cornwall, he moved
thence and took a practice in another county, where
he became acquainted with a lady residing in the
neighbourhood, who had a little money of her own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
He made her an offer, married her, and then found
that by marriage she forfeited the annuity she previously
enjoyed. After a short time he deserted
her, having first obtained possession of all her
clothes, furniture, trinkets, and so forth, which he
sold. His next affair was on board an East Indiaman
bound to Calcutta, in which he sailed as surgeon&mdash;wishing
doubtless to keep out of the way
for a while. Among the passengers was a Miss B.,
only fifteen years of age, who was going out to the
East with her mother and sisters. He succeeded in
gaining her affections, and obtained the mother’s
consent to the marriage on arrival at Calcutta. He
made out, by means of fraudulent documents prepared
on purpose, that he had inherited £5,000 from
his father, and offered to settle £3,000 on his bride.
The marriage came off in due course at Calcutta,
and then the happy pair returned to England. Soon
after their arrival, Mr. B. deserted his new wife in
a hotel in Liverpool, and after that he began the
affair which led to his detection.</p>

<p>Mr. B. is remembered in Millbank as a man of
considerable attainments. He was well educated,
and spoke several languages. One of his favourite
feats was to write the Lord’s Prayer on a scrap of
paper not larger than a sixpence, in five different
languages. In his appearance there was nothing to
justify his success with the female sex. If anything
he was plain, thereby supporting Wilkes, who asserted
that he was only five minutes behind the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
looking man in a room. In complexion Mr. B. was
dark, almost swarthy; in figure, stout. He could
not be called even gentlemanlike in his bearing. But
he had a good address; spoke well and readily; and
he was extremely shrewd and clever. As a prisoner
his conduct was all that could be desired. He passed
on like the rest eventually to Australia, where he
again married.</p>

<p>The clergymen whose crimes brought them to
Millbank were rather commonplace characters;
weak men, mostly, who could not resist their evil
propensities. Of course they were not always what
they pretended to be. One of the most noteworthy
was the Honourable and Reverend Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, who
was really an ordained minister of the Church of
England, and had held a good living in Ireland,
worth £1,400 a year. But he was passionately addicted
to the turf, and attended every meeting. His
luck varied considerably&mdash;sometimes up and sometimes
down. He came at length to lose every shilling
he had in the world at Manchester races. The
inveterate spirit of gambling was so strong within
him that he was determined to try his luck again.
He had been staying at a friend’s house&mdash;a careless
man, of good means, who left his cheque-book
too accessible to others. The Honourable and
Reverend Mr.&mdash;&mdash; went straight from the course
to his friend’s study, filled in a cheque, forged the
signature, cashed the same <i>en route</i> to the races, and
recommenced operations forthwith. Meanwhile his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
friend went also, quite by accident, to the bank for
cash. They told him a large cheque had only just
been paid to his order.</p>

<p>“I drew no cheque!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Why, here it is?”</p>

<p>“But that is not my signature.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the honourable and reverend gentleman
was incontinently arrested in the middle of the
grand stand. His sentence was transportation for
life, and from Millbank he passed on in due course
to the antipodes. He was a poor creature at the
best times, and under prison discipline became almost
imbecile and useless. After a long interval he
gained a ticket-of-leave, and was last heard of performing
divine worship at an out-station at the rate
of a shilling a service.</p>

<p>Of a very different kidney was the Rev. A. B., a
man of parts, clever and dexterous, who succeeded
in everything he tried. He spoke seven languages,
all well; and when in prison learned with ease to
tailor with the best.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar to him in character was the
Rev. Dr. B., a doctor of divinity, according to his
own statement, whose career of villainy was of long
duration. This man had served several long sentences,
which in no wise prevented his return to
crime. He also was a man of superior education,
who could read Hebrew, so the warders said, as
easily as the chaplain gave the morning prayers.
Dr. B. was discovered one day writing in Hebrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
characters in his copy-book at school time, just when
a party of distinguished visitors were inspecting the
prison. One of them, surprised, said, “What! do
you know Hebrew?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the impudent reply, “I expect a great
deal better than you do.”</p>

<p>A better story still is told of this man later, when
set at large on ticket-of-leave. Through barefaced
misrepresentation he had been permitted to take the
duty of a beneficed clergyman during his absence
from the parish. In due course came an invitation
to dine with the local magnate, whose place was
some distance from the rectory. Our ex-convict
clergyman ordered a carriage and pair from the
neighbouring town, and drove to the hall in state.
As he alighted from the carriage, his footman, hired
also for the occasion, recognized his face in the blaze
of light from the open door. “Blow me, if that
ain’t Slimy B., the chaplain’s man, who did his ‘bit’
along with us at the ‘Steel,’” he exclaimed. Both
coachman and lacquey were ex-convicts too, and
after that the secret soon leaked out. The reverend
doctor found his country parish rather too hot to
hold him. Some of his later misdeeds consisted in
decoying and plundering governesses in search of
situations; he also established himself in various
neighbourhoods as a schoolmaster, and more than
once succeeded in obtaining church duty.</p>

<p>Of the military men, the most prominent was a
certain Captain C., who belonged to an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
family, but who had fallen very low, going by degrees
from bad to worse. He was long known as
a notorious gambler and loose liver. At length,
unable to earn enough money to gratify his vices
by fair means, he sought to obtain it by foul, and
became allied to a mob of ruffians who styled themselves
“Men of the World.” In other words, he
took to obtaining goods under false pretences. Captain
C. was principally useful as a respectable reference
to whom his accomplices could apply when they
entered a strange shop and ordered goods. “Apply
to my friend Captain So-and-so, of such-and-such
a square; he has known me for years.” Reference
is made to a house gorgeously furnished, an establishment
in every way <i>bien monté</i>, the master
thereof a perfect gentleman. “Do I know Mr. &mdash;&mdash;?
Oh, dear, yes; I have known him for a
long time. He is one of my most intimate friends.
You may trust him to any amount.” Unhappily
the pitcher goes often to the well, but it is broken
at last. And at this game of fraud the circle of
operations grows naturally ever narrower. At
length the whole conspiracy became known to the
police, and Captain C. found himself ere long in
Millbank. He seems to have been treated there
rather too well for an idle, good-for-nothing rascal,
who would do no work, and who expected&mdash;so
said the officers&mdash;to be always waited upon. Undoubtedly
he was pampered, had his books from the
deputy-governor’s own library, and extra food.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
More than this, his wife&mdash;a lady once, also of
good family, but fallen with her husband to an
abyss of infamy and depravity which made her
notorious for wickedness even in this wicked city&mdash;was
frequently admitted to visit him, coming always
in silks and satins and flaunting attire, which was
sadly out of keeping with her husband’s temporary
abode.</p>

<p>Another ex-military officer was Mr. P., whose
offence at the time created wide-spread and righteous
indignation. This was the gentleman who for
some occult reason of his own, committed the
atrocity of striking our young Queen in the face
just as she was leaving the palace. The weapon he
used was a thin cane, but the blow fell lightly, as
the lady-in-waiting interposed. No explanation was
offered, except that the culprit was out of his mind.
This was the defence set up by his friends, and several
curious facts were adduced in proof of insanity.
One on which great stress was laid, was that he was
in the habit of chartering a hansom to Wimbledon
Common daily, where he amused himself by getting
out and walking as fast as he could through the
furze. But this line of defence broke down, and
the jury found the prisoner guilty. He himself,
when he came to Millbank, declared that he had
been actuated only by a desire to bring disgrace on
his family and belongings. In some way or other
he had seriously disagreed with his father, and he
took this curious means to obtain revenge. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
wantonness of the outrage called for severe punishment,
and Mr. P. was sentenced to seven years’
transportation; but the special punishment of whipping
was omitted, on the ground of the prisoner’s
position in life. Whether it was that the mere
passing of this sentence was considered sufficient,
or that the Queen herself interposed with gracious
clemency, this Mr. P. at Millbank was treated with
exceptional leniency and consideration. By order
of the Secretary of State he was exempted from
most of the restrictions by which other prisoners
were ruled. He was not lodged in a cell, but in two
rooms adjoining the infirmary, which he used as sitting
and bedroom respectively; he did not wear the
prison dress, and he had, practically, what food he
liked. He seems to have awakened a sort of sympathy
on the part of the warders who attended him;
probably because he was a fine, tall fellow, of handsome
presence and engaging manners, and because
also they thought his offence was one of hot-headed
rashness rather than premeditated wickedness.
Eventually Mr. P. went to Australia.</p>

<p>These are a few of the most prominent of the
criminals who belonged to the upper or professional
classes. Others there were, and will be, always;
but as a rule such cases are not numerous. Speaking
in general terms of the “gentleman convict,” as
viewed from the gaoler’s side, he is an ill-conditioned,
ill-conducted prisoner. When a man of energy
and determination, he wields a baleful influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
around and among other prisoners if proper precautions
are not taken against inter-communications.
His comrades look up to him, especially if he is disposed
to take the place of a ringleader and to put
himself forward as the champion of insolence and
insubordination. They render him too, a sort of
homage in their way, scrupulously retaining the
titles which have been really forfeited, if indeed they
were ever earned. Mr. So-and-so, Major This and
Captain That, are the forms of address used by Bill
Sykes when speaking of or to a gentleman convict.
For the rest, if not openly mutinous, these “superior”
felons are chiefly remarkable for their indifference
to prison rules, especially those which insist
on cleanliness and neatness in their cells. Naturally,
by habits and early education they are unskilled in
sweeping and washing, and keeping bright their
brass-work and their pewter utensils. In these respects
the London thief or hardened habitual criminal,
who knows the interior of half the prisons in
the country, has quite the best of it.</p>

<p>Somewhat lower in the social scale, but superior
also to the common burglar or thief, are those who
occupy positions of trust in banks or city offices, and
for whom the temptation of an open till or slack
administration are too strong to be resisted. A
good instance of this class was Mr. B., who was
employed as a clerk in the Bank of England. With
the assistance of a confederate who personated a
Mr. Oxenford&mdash;there was no special reason for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
selecting this gentleman, in preference to any other
Smith, Brown or Jones&mdash;he made over to himself
stock to the amount of £8,000 standing in Mr.
Oxenford’s name. His accomplice was a horse jobber.
The stock in question was paid by a cheque on
Lubbock’s for the whole sum, whither they proceeded,
asking to have it cashed&mdash;all in gold.
There were not eight thousand sovereigns available
at the moment, but they received instead eight Bank
of England notes for £1,000 each, which they
promptly changed at the bank for specie, taking with
them a carpet-bag to hold the money. The bag
when filled was found to be too heavy to lift, but
with the assistance of the bank porters it was got
into a cab. They now drove to Ben Caunt’s public
in St. Martin’s Lane, and there secured a room for
the night; the money was transferred to their portmanteaus,
several in number, and next morning
they took an early train to Liverpool <i>en route</i> for
New York. The steamer <i>Britannia</i>, in which they
took passage, started almost immediately, and they
soon got clear out of the country. But the detectives
were on their track: within a day or two, officers
followed them across the Atlantic, and landing at
Halifax found the fugitives had gone on to Boston
and New York. They were followed thither, and
on, also, to Buffalo and to Canada. Thence back
again to Boston. Here the culprits had taken up
their residence&mdash;one on a farm, the other in a
public-house, both of which had been purchased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
with the proceeds of the fraud; £7,000 had been
lodged also in the bank to their credit. One of them
was immediately arrested, and hanged himself. The
other escaped in a boat, and lay hid in the neighbouring
marshes; but the reward that was offered
led to his capture, and he was brought home to England,
where he was tried, found guilty, and sentenced
to transportation for life.</p>

<p>There were many other criminals who came in
these days to Millbank who belonged to the aristocracy
of crime, if not to the great world of
fashion. Some of them, to use their own language,
were quite top sawyers in the trade. None in this
way was more remarkable than old Cauty, who was
called the “father of all the robbers.” Few men
were better known in his time and in his own line
than Cauty. He was to be seen on every race
course, and he was on friendly terms with all the
swells on the turf. He had a large acquaintance
also among such of the “best” people in town as
were addicted to gambling on a large scale. He
was in early life a croupier or marker at several
west-end hells; but as he advanced in years he
extended his operations beyond the Atlantic, and
often made voyages by the West Indian packets.
He liked to meet Mexicans and rich Americans;
they were always ready to gamble, and as Cauty
travelled with confederates, whose expenses he paid,
he seldom lost money on the cards.</p>

<p>These, however, were his open avocations. “Under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the rose” for many years he devoted all his
abilities and his experience to planning extensive
bank robberies, which were devised generally with
so much ingenuity, and carried out with so much
daring, that a long time elapsed before the culprits
could be brought to justice. He had many dexterous
associates. Their commonest plan of action
was to hang about a bank till they saw some one
enter whom they thought likely to answer their
purpose. They followed and waited till the victim,
having opened his pocket-book, or produced his
cheque, was paid his money over the counter. At
that moment a button dropped, or a slight push,
which was followed by immediate apology, took off
attention, and in that one instant the money or a
part of it was gone&mdash;passed from hand to hand,
and removed at once from the building.</p>

<p>Cauty came to grief at last. Of course he was
known to the police, but the difficulty was to take
him red-handed. The opportunity arrived when,
with an accomplice, he made an attempt to rob the
cashier of the London and Westminster Bank of
his box. They were both watched in and out of
the bank in St. James’s Square day after day. The
police kept them constantly in sight, and the cashier
himself was put on his guard. The latter admitted
that the cash-box was at times left unavoidably
within the reach of dishonest people, and that it
contained property sometimes worth £100,000 or
more. But if the police were patient in the watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
they set, the thieves were equally patient in waiting
for a chance. Once at the moment of fruition
they were just “sold” by the appearance of a police-sergeant,
who came in to change a cheque. But at
length, almost as a conjuror does a trick, they accomplished
their purpose. Cauty went into the
bank first, carrying a rather suspicious-looking
black bag. Three minutes afterwards he came out
without it, and raised his hat three times, which
was the signal “all right” to his accomplice. The
latter, Tyler, a returned convict, thereupon entered
the bank in his turn, and almost immediately
brought away the bag. The two worthies were allowed
to go without let or hindrance as far as the
Haymarket, and then secured. The black bag was
opened&mdash;inside was the cash-box.</p>

<p>This brought Cauty’s career to an end. He got
twenty years, and then it came out how extensive
was the business he had done. Through his hands
had passed not a little of the “swag” in all the
principal robberies of the day&mdash;all the gold from
the gold-dust robberies, all the notes and bills stolen
from big banking houses. It was said that in this
way he had touched about half-a-million of money.</p>

<p>Some years afterwards another leader and prince
in the world of crime was unearthed in the person
of a Jew&mdash;Moses Moses&mdash;whose headquarters
were in Gravel Lane, Houndsditch, and who was
discovered to be a gigantic receiver of stolen goods.
He was only detected by accident. A quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
wool was traced to his premises, and these were
thereupon rigorously examined. In lofts and in
many other hiding-places, were found vast heaps of
missing property. Much was identified as the
product of recent burglaries. There was leather in
large quantities, plush also, cloth and jewelry. A
wagon-load of goods was, it was said, taken away,
and in it pieces of scarlet damask, black and crimson
cloth, doeskin, silver articles, shawls, and upwards
of fifty rings. An attempt was made to
prove that Moses was new to the business, and had
been led astray by the wicked advice and example
of another man. But the Recorder would not believe
that operations of this kind could be carried
on by a novice or a dupe, and he sentenced Mr.
Moses to transportation for fourteen years.</p>

<p>For unblushing effrontery and insolence, so to
speak, in criminal daring, the case of King the
police-officer and detective, is almost without parallel.
Although supposed to be a thief-taker by profession,
he was really an instigator and supporter
of crime. He formed by degrees a small gang of
pickpockets, and employed them to steal for him,
giving them full instruction and ample advice. He
took them to the best hunting-grounds, and not only
covered them while at work, but gave them timely
warning in case of danger, or if the neighbourhood
became too hot to hold them. His pupils were few
in number, but they were industrious and seemingly
highly successful. One boy stated his earnings at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
from £90 to £100 a week. King was a kind and
liberal master to his boys. They lived on the fat
of the land. Reeves, who gave information of the
system pursued by King, said he had a pony to ride
in the park, and that they all went to theatres and
places of amusement whenever they pleased. The
rascally ingenuity of King in turning to his own
advantage his opportunities as an officer of the law
savours somewhat of Vidocq and the <i>escrocs</i> of
Paris. King got fourteen years.</p>

<p>But the most notorious prisoners in Millbank
were not always to be found on the “male side.”
Equally famous in their own way were some of the
female convicts&mdash;women like Alice Grey, whose
career of imposture at the time attracted great attention,
and was deservedly closed by committal to
Millbank on a long sentence of transportation.
Alice Grey was a young lady of artless appearance
and engaging manners. Her favourite form of
misconduct was to bring false charges against unfortunate
people who had never seen her in their
lives. Thus, she accused two boys of snatching a
purse from her hand in the street, and when a number
were paraded for her inspection she readily
picked out the offenders. “Her evidence was so
ingenuous,” says the report, “that her story was
implicitly believed, and the boys were remanded for
trial.” As a sort of compensation to Miss Grey
(her real name was “Brazil,” but she had several&mdash;among
others, Anastasia Haggard, Felicia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Macarthy, Jane Tureau, Agnes Hemans, etc.) she
was given a good round sum from the poor-box.
But she was not always so successful. She was
sentenced to three months in Dublin for making a
false charge, and eighteen months soon afterwards
at Greenock. At Stafford she accused a poor working
man of stealing her trunk, value £8; when put
into the box she was taxed with former mistakes of
this kind, whereupon she showed herself at once
in her true colours and reviled every one present
in a long tirade of abuse. Her cleverness was, however,
sufficient to have made her fortune if she had
turned her talents to honest account.</p>

<p>There was more dash about women like Louisa
M. or Emily L. The former drove up to Hunt and
Roskell’s in her own carriage to look at some bracelets.
They were for Lady Campbell, and she was
Miss Constance Browne. Her bankers were Messrs.
Cocks and Biddulph. Finally she selected bracelets
and head ornaments to the value of £2,500, which
were to be brought to her house that evening by
two assistants from the shop, who accordingly
called at the hour named. The door was opened by
a page. “Pray walk upstairs.” Miss Browne
walks in. “The bracelets? Ah, I will take them
up to Lady Campbell, who is confined to her room.”
The head assistant demurred a little, but Miss
Browne said, “Surely you know my bankers? I
mentioned them to-day. Messrs. Hunt and Roskell
have surely satisfied themselves?” With that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
jewels were taken upstairs. Half an hour passes.
One assistant looks at the other. Another half hour.
What does it mean? One rings the bell. No answer.
The other tries the door. It is locked.
Then, all at once discovering the trap, they both
throw up the window and call in the police. They
are released, but the house is empty. Pursuit, however,
is set on foot, and Miss Constance Browne is
captured the same night in a second class carriage
upon the Great Western Railway, and when
searched she was found to have on her a quantity
of diamonds, a £100 note, rings and jewelry of all
sorts, including the missing bracelets. She had
laid her plans well. The house&mdash;which was Lady
Campbell’s&mdash;she had hired furnished, that day,
paying down the first instalment of rent. The page
she had engaged and fitted with livery also that very
day, and the moment he had shown up the jeweller’s
men she had sent him to the Strand with a note.
Here was cleverness superior to that of Alice Grey.</p>

<p>Probably Emily L. carried off the palm from
both. As an adroit and daring thief she has had
few equals. She is described as a most affable, ladylike,
fascinating woman, well educated, handsome,
and of pleasing address. She could win almost any
one over. The shopmen fell at her feet, so to speak,
when she alighted from her brougham and condescended
to enter and give her orders. She generally
assumed the title of Countess L., but her chief associate
and ally was a certain James P., who was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
lapidary by trade, an excellent judge of jewels, and
a good looking respectable young fellow&mdash;to all
appearance&mdash;besides. They were long engaged in
a series of jewel robberies on a large scale, but escaped
detection. Fate overtook them at last, and
they were both arrested at the same time. One
charge was for stealing a diamond locket, value
£2,000, from Mr. Emanuel, and a diamond bracelet
worth £600 from Hunt and Roskell. At the same
moment there cropped up another charge of stealing
loose diamonds in Paris to the tune of £10,000.
Emily was sentenced to four years, and from the
moment she entered prison she resolved to give all
the trouble she could. Her conduct at Millbank and
at the prison to which she passed, was atrocious;
had the discipline been less severe she would probably
have rivalled some of the ill-conducted women
to whom I referred in the last volume. But at the
expiration of her sentence she returned to her evil
ways outside. Brighton was the scene of her next
misfortune. She there entered a jeweller’s shop,
and having put him quite off his guard by her insinuating
manners, stole £1,000 worth from under
his nose, and while he was actually in conversation
with her. The theft was not discovered till she was
just leaving Brighton. Apprehended at the station,
she indignantly denied the charge, asserting that
she was a lady of high rank, and offering bail to
any amount. But she was detained, and a London
detective having been called in, she was at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
identified. For this she got seven years, and was
sent to Millbank once more. This extraordinary
woman, notwithstanding the vigorous examination
to which all incoming prisoners were subjected, succeeded
in bringing in with her a number of valuable
diamonds. But they were subsequently discovered
in spite of the strange steps she took to secrete them.</p>

very quiet&mdash;Cases of weakened intellect and insanity&mdash;Rules

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the criminals of the period were passing
in and out of Millbank, and Mr. Nihil, backed up
by his committee, was working indefatigably and
with the best intentions, the credit of the establishment
was suddenly impugned in no measured terms.
It was doubtful indeed whether the ship could
weather the storm of invective that broke upon it.
Had the managers of Millbank been ogres instead
of painstaking philanthropists working for the public
good, they could not have been more rancorously
assailed. But here was a case where the people suffered
because their rulers squabbled. It was a
period when party warfare ran high and the Opposition
hailed eagerly any opportunity of bringing
discredit upon the Ministry. The attack made upon
the Penitentiary was really directed against the
Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 26th February, 1838, a noble lord rose in
his place to call the attention of the House of Lords
to a grave failure in the administration of criminal
justice. “All London, the whole country, was
ringing with it,” said another noble lord. “It has
been a topic of universal reprobation co-extensive
with the hourly increasing sphere in which it has
been known. All Westminster has talked of it, all
Middlesex has turned its eyes to the quarter in
which the abuse occurred. I will venture to say,”
continued his lordship, “that it has been more
talked of, more discussed, more indignantly commented
upon in every corner of this great town
and of this populous country, than any one subject
either in or out of Parliament, or in any one of the
courts of justice, civil or criminal.” It appeared
that in Millbank, a prison exempt from the general
jurisdiction of the county magistrates, and governed
only by the Home Secretary, there had occurred
five cases of unwarranted harshness and
cruelty. Three little girls and two fine young men
had been completely broken down by the system of
solitary confinement therein practised. The children
were mere infants: one, as it was alleged, was
little more than seven years old; the other two were
eight and ten respectively. Yet at this tender age
they had been cut off entirely from the consoling
influences of home and the kindly intercourse of
relatives and companions, to be immured in solitary
wretchedness for nearly thirteen consecutive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
months. So bitterly did these little ones lament
the loneliness of their lengthened seclusion, that
one asked piteously for a doll to keep her company,
and all three were found at different times sleeping
with their bedclothes twisted to simulate a baby,
so earnestly did they yearn for something like ideal
society in their dreary confinement. More than
this: the punishment of continued solitude had
produced in them a marked infirmity of mind, manifested
by great impediment of speech, and general
difficulty in the expression of ideas. A gentleman,
one of the Middlesex magistrates, who had visited
the Penitentiary, described the effect upon their
speech such as to render their voices “feeble, low,
and inarticulate&mdash;to produce a kind of inward
speaking, visible to and palpable to every one who
heard them.” So much for the children. As for
the young men, one of them, who had previously
been remarkable for great activity and intelligence,
came out in a state of idiocy, and was afterwards
retained as an idiot in St. Marylebone workhouse,
reduced to such a state of utter and helpless imbecility
as to be incapable of being employed even in
breaking stones. The other was similarly affected.
And yet all this was contrary to law. Here were
prisoners subjected to uninterrupted solitary confinement
for twelve and thirteen months, when by
a recent Act it was expressly ordered that no such
punishment should last for more than one month at
a time, and never for more than three months in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the year. Circumstances very disgraceful beyond
doubt, if the charge were only proved, and entailing
a weight of awful responsibility on those who
were accountable to the public.</p>

<p>As the attack was made without a word of warning,
Lord Melbourne, at that time the head of the
Government, was unable to defend himself. All he
could urge was that the House should reserve its
opinion until upon a close investigation the grievances
and evils alleged should be proved to exist.
He felt certain that the whole statement was exaggerated
and over-coloured; of this he had, indeed,
no doubt, but he must claim a little time before
he made a specific reply.</p>

<p>The next night he stated that full inquiry had
been made. In the first place the ages of the children
had been understated. Each of them was at
least ten years old. But this was not a point of any
very material importance. They were all three very
profligate children. One of the worst signs of the
day was the great increase of crimes committed by
children of tender age. The principal cause of this
was, no doubt, the wickedness of parents, who made
their children the instruments for carrying out their
own evil designs. In the present instance the three
girls had been guilty of theft and sentenced to transportation,
but they were recommended for the Penitentiary
solely to remove them for a lengthened
period from the influence of their parents, and to
give the Government an opportunity of effecting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
reform in their character and conduct. The only
place suitable for such an attempt was the Millbank
Penitentiary, and to this they were removed. This
establishment was governed by rules laid down by
the Lords’ Committee of 1835, and, therefore, if
undue severity had been practised, it must have been
in defiance of those very rules. But it was quite
untrue that any of these prisoners had been subjected
to protracted solitary confinement. There
was no such thing in the Penitentiary except for
prison offences, and then only for short periods.
Separate confinement there certainly was, but solitary
confinement&mdash;complete seclusion, that is to
say, without being seen, without going out to public
worship&mdash;as a general practice was practically
unknown in the establishment.</p>

<p>“These children took exercise regularly twice a
day, for half an hour at a time, in company with
other prisoners of their ward; they had school also
together twice a week; went to chapel on Sunday;
and were regularly visited by benevolent Christian
ladies (Mrs. Fry and her associates), who spent
long hours in their cells. Surely their condition
was not one of great hardship!</p>

<p>“The young men, Welsh and Ray, were notorious
rogues, who had also been sent to the Penitentiary
to effect, if possible, some reformation in their ill-conducted
and irregular lives. Their behaviour
had been very rebellious and disorderly, but though
they had been frequently punished they had left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Penitentiary at the expiration of their terms of
imprisonment in perfect health and full possession
of all their faculties.”</p>

<p>The Opposition laughed at the explanation. Not
solitary confinement&mdash;what was it then? The children
went out to exercise. Yes; but they were not
allowed to communicate or talk to one another.
They went to church, and to school, but only for a
few hours together in the week, and for the rest of
the time they were shut up in their cells alone,
utterly alone. Was not this solitary confinement?
Were these accusations all unfounded then? Had
they been disproved? Let the Government wait till
a committee of the House had been appointed to
inquire and had reported upon the whole case.</p>

<p>A committee met, took evidence, and at the end
of a month sent in their report. It was quite conclusive.
The whole of the charges necessarily fell
at once to the ground. “On the whole,” they stated,
in summing up, “the committee think it due to the
officers of the Penitentiary to state, that all the
convicts have been treated with all the leniency,
and&mdash;in the case of the female children particularly&mdash;with
all the attention to their moral improvement
that was consistent with the rules laid
down for the government of the Penitentiary.”
The children had come in dirty, ignorant, and in
ill health; they were now cleanly, had learned to
read, could make shirts, and were all quite well
and strong. Nothing was wrong with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
voices: one could shout as loud as any girl of
her age, but she was shy before strangers; the
second led the singing of the hymns in her ward,
though her voice was only of ordinary power,
and had been even husky from the time of her
reception; the third usually spoke from choice in
a low tone, but she had been heard to shout often
enough to other prisoners. It was quite evident,
then, that in these three cases, not only had the
cruelty been distinctly disproved, but it was equally
clear that their imprisonment in the Penitentiary
had been a positive benefit to the children in question.</p>

<p>Nor was the charge a bit better substantiated in
the case of the two “fine young men.” Both of
them had been cast for death at the Old Bailey,
which was commuted afterwards to one year in the
Penitentiary. One, Welsh, was a good-for-nothing
vagrant, who had spent most of the seventeen years
he had lived inside the Marylebone workhouse, and
to this he had returned on his release from Millbank.
He was a clever but unruly prisoner; he
could read and write well, and his faculties had
been sharpened rather than impaired by his residence
in prison. The master of the Marylebone
workhouse was decidedly of opinion that he had
improved much; he was more civil now than before,
and he was greatly grown. Welsh said himself
he had no fault to find with the Penitentiary;
in fact, he was quite ready to go back to it, if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
would only take him in. But this Welsh was in
the habit of counterfeiting idiocy, either to procure
some extra indulgences, or to amuse himself
and others, and he played the part so well that
many who saw him were deceived.</p>

<p>William Ray, the other “victim,” was older,
having reached his twenty-fifth year. He also had
passed the greater part of his life in the Marylebone
workhouse; but he had enlisted twice into
the army, and had gone with Sir de Lacy Evans
to Spain. He had been discharged for incompetence,
and it was perfectly clear from the evidence
taken, that he was a person of very weak
intellect long before he became an inmate of the
prison: he had a vacant countenance, a silly laugh,
and a habit of blinking his eyes and tossing his
head about. Still he perfectly understood what he
was ordered to do. He had become a good tailor,
and had improved in reading.</p>

<p>Thus all the charges were disposed of, and the
system in force having been held blameless, it might
fairly be continued without change. The system
then was as follows: The prisoners slept in separate
cells which opened into a common passage,
and at the centre of the passage was the warder’s
bedroom. The cells were ten feet by seven, and
had a partition wall between them fourteen inches
thick. The entrance to each cell had two doors&mdash;one
of open iron work, the other of wood. At the
first bell, every morning about daylight, the prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
were let out to wash, about six or eight at a
time; and they then returned to their cells for the
rest of the day, except during their two hours’ exercise,
and twice a week when they attended chapel
and school. Their meals were brought to them
in their cells by other prisoners let out for the purpose.
The chaplain, assistant chaplain, and schoolmaster
were continually visiting them. All day
long the wooden door of the cell remained wide
open, and there were plenty of opportunities of
talking to their neighbours through the gate of
iron grating, where even a whisper could be heard.
They were always talking&mdash;at washing time, at
exercise, even when in their cells with both doors
locked and bolted. Now this was manifestly not
solitary confinement. Nay, more, it was not even
separate confinement. But yet, without the latter,
without perfect isolation and the prevention of all
intercourse and intercommunication, it was felt by
Mr. Nihil that his efforts to reform his prisoners
were vain. Whatever good his counsels might
accomplish was immediately counteracted by the
vicious converse that still went on in spite of all
attempts to check it. It was found that extensive
communications were carried on; that prisoners
learned each other’s histories, formed friendships
and enmities, and contrived in many ways to do
each other harm. Unless this were ended all hope
of permanent cure was out of the question. Mr.
Nihil says, in 1838, that he is in great hope that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
by the thorough separation of the prisoners, important
advantages in respect to the efficiency of
imprisonment and the reformation of the convicts
would ensue. “The more perfect isolation of the
prisoner by non-intercourse with fellow-criminals,
not only renders the punishment more effective,
but places him in a condition more susceptible to
the good influences with which we seek to visit
him&mdash;now constantly frustrated by communication
through the wards.”</p>

<p>So eager were the authorities to restrict the
means of intercourse, that they were not above
taking the advice of a prisoner on the subject. His
suggestions were such as a prisoner is qualified to
give, being the fruits of experience, and an intimate
acquaintance with the various devices that are
practised. If talking was to be prevented, he said,
several new arrangements must be made; thus the
officer, when prisoners were at exercise, instead of
standing motionless should walk on an inner circle,
in an opposite direction to the prisoners, so as to
see their faces. The prisoners always talked whenever
the officer’s back was turned. Nor should
they be allowed to eat while in the yard: under
the pretence of chewing they really were engaged
in conversation. Again, to put an end to clandestine
letters, all the blank pages of library books
should be numbered and frequently examined, so
that none might be abstracted and used as writing
paper. Nor should any whiting be issued to clean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the pewters: the prisoners only used it to lay a
thick white coat upon any damped paper, thus
making a surface to write upon. By scraping off
the whiting the same paper could be used over and
over again. To make a pencil they scraped their
pewter pints, then with the heat from the tailors’
iron, with which many were supplied, they ran
these scrapings into a mould. Lastly, all searching
of cells and prisoners should be more frequent and
complete; care should be taken in the latter case
to examine the cuff and collar of the jacket, the
waistband and the lower part of the legs of the
trousers, and the cap. The bedding in the cells, all
cracks in floor or shopboard, and the battens or
little pieces below the tables should be thoroughly
overhauled. With such precautions as these much
might be effected; nevertheless, said the informer,
misconduct must always continue, for prisoners
often incurred reports solely to gain the character
of heroes.</p>

<p>And so with the new year many further changes
were introduced. All the governor’s recommendations
were adopted, and not a few of the suggestions
last quoted, in spite of the source from which
they came. Within a week or two&mdash;rather soon,
perhaps&mdash;the governor considers that the new discipline
works extremely well. Reports diminish,
and the control of officers is more complete. Ill-tempered
prisoners evinced great annoyance at the
change; but by meeting this spirit by firmness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
good temper it has, he thinks, been repressed.
Three months later he notices a distinct improvement
in behaviour, traceable beyond question to the
new rules. Prisoners formerly constantly reported
are now quite quiet, and in a very good state of
mind&mdash;tractable, submissive, and grateful. “Several
had learned to read; and many evinced a softened
and subdued tone of feelings, and thanked
God they had been brought to the Penitentiary.
Some expressed a grateful sense of the value of the
late regulations. One youth told me that previously
they might almost as well have been in the
same room with a crowd.... In Thomas Langdale,
a desperate housebreaker and a very depraved
man, the most hopeful change has taken
place. He has written a most artless and interesting
letter to his wife.... Some prisoners have
acquired a great mastery over their violent tempers,
and look quite cheerful and happy.... A few
only still manifest great discontent.”</p>

<p>All that year the principle has ample trial. In
April, 1840, the governor asserts that in his opinion
the state of the prison is highly satisfactory. The
prisoners, as testified by their letters (which were
meant for him to see), were as happy as the day
was long. They had good food, good clothing, and
spoke with gratitude of the provision made for
their religious instruction. Moreover, now the
reins are as tight as they can be drawn. “Separation
has within the last two years been much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
carried out than formerly, and the effect has been
very materially to reduce offences and punishments,
and to promote reformation,” says Mr. Nihil. His
great difficulty now is that he cannot ventilate the
cell without opening the door to communication.
In fact he might seem to wish to seal up his prisoners
hermetically; but he says, “I do not mean
to advocate long separation from all social communication.
I should prefer a system of regulated
intercourse upon a plan of classification and superintendence
and mutual education, guarded by occasional
separation. What I object to is nominal
separation accompanied with secret fraudulent
vicious communication. Health is certainly a great
consideration, but are morals less? Ought health
to be sought by the rash demolition of an important
moral fence? If health is alone to be looked to it
would be very easy to suggest very simple means
for keeping the prisoners in general good health;
but then the objects of imprisonment would be altogether
frustrated. Considering these objects indispensable,
and that one of them is the moral
reformation of the prisoners, I conceive it would
be much better to leave them to the remedy of opening
their cell windows for fresh air.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nihil’s notions were certainly clearly developed.
He was for no half measures. But in
his extreme eagerness to push his theory as far as
it could go, he actually courted disaster. He was
apparently blinded by a misconception of phrases.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
So long as he steered clear of what was called solitary
confinement he thought he was safe. But he
forgot that the more separation was insisted upon,
the more nearly solitude was approached. In point
of fact there was absolutely no distinction between
the separate confinement practised at Millbank,
and that solitary confinement which had already
been universally condemned, and which by law was
not to be inflicted except for very limited periods
of time. Naturally the same fatal consequences,
the inevitable results that follow such imprisonment
protracted beyond the extreme limit, began
to be plainly visible. Cases of insanity, or weakened
intellect came to light, first in solitary instances,
then more and more frequently. The committee
were compelled to run counter to Mr. Nihil,
and relax the rigorous separation from which he
hoped to effect so much. I find in their report for
1841 that they consider it necessary to make great
alterations in the discipline of the institution.</p>

<p>“In consequence of a distressing increase in the
number of insane prisoners, the committee, under
sanction of the medical superintendent, came to
the resolution that it would be unsafe to continue
a system of strict separation for the long periods
to which the ordinary sentences of the prisoners in
the Penitentiary extend. They therefore propose
that the system should be relaxed with regard to
all classes of prisoners except two; viz., military
prisoners whose sentences were extremely short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
and persons convicted of unnatural offences; and
that to all other prisoners the prohibition of intercourse
should be limited to the first three months
after their admission, and that upon the expiration
of that period they should be placed upon a system
of modified intercourse.” But they surrendered
their views evidently with the utmost reluctance,
and remarked further in this report that “they
are inclined to believe that no scheme of discipline
in which intercourse between prisoners, however
modified, forms an essential part, is ever likely to
be made instrumental either to the prevention of
crime or to the personal reformation of convicts
to the same degree as a system of separation.
Whether the latter system can be rendered compatible
with the maintenance of the mental sanity
of the prisoners is a subject of much controversy,
and can only be determined by actual experiment,
accompanied by such advantages as are proposed
in the Model Prison.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>But it now becomes plainly evident that the
waters are beginning to close over the Penitentiary.
There are people outside its walls who are clearly
not its friends, if not openly inimical. Thus dissatisfaction
finds voice in the House of Commons,
where, on the 15th March, 1841, Mr. Alderman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Copeland asks for certain information which the
prison authorities must have found it awkward to
supply. This return called for was to show the
numbers sent to the Penitentiary during the past
five years; the number removed during that period
for insanity, the number for bad health, and who
had died; and it was to be stated how often the
several members of the committee attended during
the year.</p>

<p>From different causes, one difficulty added to
another, the Penitentiary was drawing nearer and
nearer to its doom. At length its death-blow fell,
accelerated doubtless by the sweeping alterations
contemplated in the whole system of secondary
punishments. These changes, by which also the
whole constitution of the Penitentiary was altered,
will be detailed at length in another volume, and
the closing chapter shall be devoted to the last days
of old Millbank.</p>

<p>It was on the 5th May, 1843, that Sir James
Graham, then Home Secretary, introduced a Bill
for the better regulation of the Penitentiary. The
House must be fully aware, he said, of the Report<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
in which it was stated that as a <i>penitentiary</i> “Millbank
Prison had been an entire failure.” Its functions,
therefore, in that respect were now to cease.
The next thing to be considered was what use
might be made of it, for it was a large building and
had many conveniences for a prison. Just at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
moment, however, the Government had determined
to carry out a certain new classification of all convicts
sentenced to transportation. In other words,
felons were to suffer this punishment in different
degrees, according to their condition and character.
But to ascertain in which category offenders should
be placed a time of probation and proof was needed,
and this period should be passed at some general
depot, where for nine or ten months the character
of each convict might be tested. Millbank was admirably
suited for the purpose. From here, after
the necessary interval, the juveniles were to be sent
on to the new prison at Parkhurst, the best and
most promising convicts to Pentonville, the rest to
the hulks, but one and all only <i>in transitu</i> to the
antipodes.</p>

<p>Nothing now remained but for the Penitentiary
Committee to go through the ceremony of the
happy despatch; for by the new arrangements the
control of the prison was to be vested in a body of
government inspectors, and of a governor acting
under them. Under the new system, the committee
states, “there will be a rapid succession of transports
continually passing through the prison; and
the shortness of their confinement, though very
desirable on the score of health, will necessarily
militate against any great mental or moral improvement.”
Nothing is intimated as to the nature
of the discipline to which the transports are to be
subjected during their detention here. The committee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
however, “are satisfied that a vigorous system
will be found necessary for the maintenance
of order among criminals of so depraved and desperate
a character as the male transports are evidently
expected to be. In short, it is obvious that
an entirely new state of things is at hand, one never
contemplated by any members of the committee
when they originally consented to act; one moreover
which will require, in their opinion, an active
and unremitting superintendence such as their
other avocations render them incapable of undertaking.”
Therefore one and all of them were glad
to resign their functions into other hands. But
they “cannot conclude without remarking that the
new system contemplated would never be properly
administered by a clerical governor, even if he considered
it consistent with his sacred functions to
undertake such a charge.”</p>

<p>I find in the minutes of the committee on the 9th
June, 1843, all members were requested to
attend at their next meeting, which was probably
to be their last.</p>

<p>At the same time they passed votes of thanks
also to the assistant-chaplain, the medical superintendent,
the matron, manufacturers, steward, and
officers generally. And from that time forth Millbank,
as a penitentiary, ceased to exist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the changes which were instituted in Millbank
in 1843, its character and constitution were
alike materially altered. It was a penitentiary no
longer, for it did not now deserve the high-sounding
title. The lofty purposes with which it started
were unfulfilled, and its future usefulness depended
upon the wide area it embraced within its gloomy
walls, rather than on the results its reformatory
system might be expected to achieve. But as a
plain prison, it might yet render more tangible service
to the state. And just as Millbank became
more practically useful than heretofore, so those
who ruled it were no longer amateurs. The superintending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
committee, composed of well-disposed
gentlemen of rank, were replaced by a board of
three permanent inspectors, two of whom were already
well known to prison history. Mr. Crawford,
the senior member, had given much time to
the examination of the American prisons; and Mr.
Whitworth Russell, the second member, had been
for years chaplain of Millbank. Both also had been
long employed as inspectors of all prisons in England.
Under them was a new governor&mdash;a person
of a different stamp from mild Captain Chapman,
or pious, painstaking Mr. Nihil. Captain John B.
Groves, a gentleman of some position and not unknown
in society, was also a military officer of distinction.
He did not seek the appointment, but as
those in high places who knew his character thought
him eminently well suited for the post, he was told
that if he applied he could have it. A soldier, firm
and resolute of will, but clear-headed, practical,
able, Captain Groves had but one fault,&mdash;he was
of an irascible temper. However, like many other
passionate men, though quickly aroused, he was as
speedily cooled. After an outburst of wrath he
was as bright and pleasant as a summer landscape
when the thunderstorm has passed. Added to this
was a certain roughness of demeanour, which,
though native often to men of his cloth, might easily
be mistaken for overbearing, peremptory harshness.
But that Captain Groves was well-suited for
the task that had devolved upon him there could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
be little doubt. The Millbank he was called upon
to rule differed more or less from the old Penitentiary
which had just been wiped out by Act of
Parliament. The population was no longer permanent,
but fluctuating: instead of two or three
hundred men and youths specially chosen to remain
within the walls for years, Captain Groves had to
take in all that came, <i>en route</i> for the colonies; so
that in the twelve months several thousands passed
through his hands. Moreover, among these thousands
were the choicest specimens of criminality,
male and female, ripe always for desperate deeds,
and at times almost unmanageable; yet these
scoundrels he had to discipline and keep under with
only such means as Mr. Nihil had left behind; for
the most part the same staff of warders and with
no increase in their numbers. And with all the
difficulties of maintaining his repressive measures,
were the gigantic worries inseparable from a depot
prison, such as Millbank had become. The constant
change of numbers; the daily influx of new
prisoners, in batches varying from twos and threes
to forties and fifties, in all degrees of discipline&mdash;sometimes
drunk, always dirty, men and women
occasionally chained together; the continuous outflow
of prisoners to the convict transport ships&mdash;a
draft of one hundred one day, three hundred the
next, all of whom must carefully be inspected,
tended, and escorted as far as the Nore,&mdash;these
were among the many duties of his charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>But Captain Groves soon seated himself firmly
in the saddle, and made himself felt as master. The
promptitude with which he grasped the position is
proved by his early orders. On the first day he
found out that there were no standing regulations
in case of fire. No fixed system or plan of action
was established, but it was left to the governor, at
the moment of emergency, to issue such instructions
as might suggest themselves. There were no
stations at which the several officials should take
post on the first alarm, no regular practice with the
fire engine; the machine itself was quite insufficient,
and the hose out of repair. There had been
one or two fires already inside the prison, and the
consequences had been sufficiently disastrous; yet
no attempt had been made to reduce the chances by
previous forethought and arrangement. Captain
Groves begged therefore to be permitted to frame
regulations in advance and in cold blood, instead
of leaving the calamity to be coped with amid the
excitement of an actual conflagration. The fire
question disposed of, the governor turned his eyes
upon the appearance of the men under his charge;
and, true soldier again, I find him complaining
seriously of the slouching gait and slovenly garb
of the warders trained under the late regime. “I
think,” he says, “that the officers when together
on parade, or at other times, should present something
of the appearance of a military body.” He
wished, therefore, to give them drill, and a waist-belt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
and a smarter uniform. Again, he found fault
with the armoury, and remarked that all the fire-arms
in the prison consisted of one or two old
blunderbusses, with brass barrels exceedingly short,
and he suggested a stand of fifty carbines from the
Tower. Next he made a raid upon the dishevelled
locks of the convicts, remarking: “The practice of
cutting the prisoners’ hair appears to be much neglected.
I observe the majority of the prisoners’
heads are dirty; the hair long, and the whiskers
growing under the chin.” To remedy this, he introduced
forthwith the principles of the military
barbers of that time,&mdash;the hair to be short on the
top and sides of the head and whiskers trimmed on
a level with the lower part of the ear&mdash;an innovation
which the prisoners resented, resisting the execution
of the order, one to the extent of saying
that the next time he was given a razor he would
cut his throat with it. But the rules were enforced,
as all other rules that issued from Captain Groves.
Not that the adjustment of such trifles satisfied his
searching spirit of reorganization. He was much
annoyed at the idleness and determined laziness of
all the prisoners. They did not do half the work
they might; the tailoring was a mere farce, and
the little boys in Tothill Fields Prison picked twice
as much coir-junk as full grown men in Millbank,
and in a shorter time. As for great-coats, the
average turned out was one per week, while they
should have been able to complete three or four at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
least. The governor attributed this chiefly to the
undercurrent of opposition to his orders from officers
of the manufacturing department.</p>

<p>Indeed, not only from this branch, but from all
his subordinates, Captain Groves appears to have
got but half-hearted service. The double-faced
backbitings, which had brought many to preferment
in the last regime, were thrown away on the
new governor. He preferred to see things with
his own eyes, and he did not encourage officers to
tell tales of one another. When a senior officer
reported a junior for using bad language, Captain
Groves remarked, “I must state my apprehensions
that the practice which has prevailed of <i>watching</i>
for bad or gross language uttered by warders off
duty, and reported without their knowledge, accompanied
by additions to the actual offence, will be
most certain to introduce discussion and discord
into the prison, and produce universal distrust and
fear. No warder can feel himself safe when he
knows that an unguarded word may be brought
against him at some future day.” The practical
common sense of these remarks no one can deny;
but those who knew Captain Groves will smile as
they remember that his own language at times
savoured “of the camps,” and he possibly felt that
under such a system of espionage he might himself
be caught tripping. But in setting his face against
the old practices he was clearly right, although it
might bring him into disfavour with those hypocritical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
subordinates who felt that their day of
favour was over. Of most of the Penitentiary officers,
indeed, Captain Groves had formed but a
low estimate. In more ways than one he had found
them lax, just as he found that the routine of duties
was but carelessly arranged. There was no system:
the night patrols, two in number to every
two pentagons, slept as they pleased half the night
or more, and were seldom subject to the visits of
“rounds” or other impertinences from over-zealous
officials; no one was responsible for the
prison during the night; by day, strangers came
and went through the inner gates and passed on
to the innermost part of the prison, ostensibly to
buy shoes and other articles made by the prisoners,
but really to see their friends among the latter;
coal porters, irresponsible persons, often from the
lowest classes (one was afterwards a convict),
were admitted with their sacks into the heart of the
wards, male and female, and could converse and
traffic with the prisoners all day long. There was
no notice board at the gates or elsewhere to warn
visitors of the penalties of wrong-doing.</p>

<p>In all these matters the reform that was so urgently
needed Captain Groves introduced, and that
with no faltering hand. Naturally in the process
he trod on many toes, rubbed up many old prejudices,
and made himself generally unpopular. Nor
was the bad feeling lessened when it became known
that he looked on the bulk of the old officers as inefficient,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
and recommended their dismissal <i>en masse</i>.
Discontent grew and rankled among the majority;
but although nearly all chafed under the tightened
bit, few for a long time went beyond a certain insolent
restiveness, though some were brave enough
to complain against the governor’s tyranny and to
talk of active resistance. It was not, however, till
Captain Groves had been in office nearly three years
that all these muttered grumblings took shape in
an actual combination against him. Of this he had
notice, for a paper was put into his hand giving
full disclosures and a list of the conspirators, many
of whom he had thought trustworthy men; but he
disdained to act on the information. The malcontents
were not, however, to be disarmed by his
magnanimity. Feeling certain that their case was
strong, and that they could substantiate their
charges against him, one of their number, in the
name of all, presented a petition to the House of
Commons, praying for an inquiry into the condition
of Millbank Prison. This petition was signed by
Edward Baker, ex-warder, and it was laid upon the
table of the House by Mr. Duncombe, M. P.</p>

<p>Baker’s petition set forth that he had filled the
office of warder for more than three years, but that
he had at length been compelled to resign “in consequence
of the oppressive and tyrannical conduct”
on the part of Captain Groves, the governor of the
prison, towards the prisoners and officers themselves.
He also impugned the character of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
governor, charging him with drunkenness and the
habitual use of foul language, and indirectly reflecting
on the three inspectors, who in permitting such
malpractices had culpably neglected their duties.</p>

<p>The first allegation was that on one occasion a
prisoner, Chinnery, had a fit in the airing-yard, just
before the governor entered it.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter here?” asked Captain
Grove.</p>

<p>“A prisoner in a fit.”</p>

<p>“A fit&mdash;he’s not in a fit!” (He was standing on
his feet.)</p>

<p>“No, he’s reviving.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said the governor, “he never had
a fit. If this man has any more of his tricks report
him to me.”</p>

<p>Further, the governor had sent the supervisor
to bring up the prisoner for this same feigning
of a fit, and had sentenced him, without medical
testimony, to three days’ bread and water. Yet this
very Chinnery had been in the prison under a previous
sentence, and had been lodged always next
door to a warder, so that assistance might always
be at hand when he had a fit.</p>

<p>The next charge was that the governor had sentenced
three boys for opening their Bibles in church,
to seven days’ bread and water, censuring them for
such conduct, “which he considered irreverent.”
(The words are Baker’s.)</p>

<p>The third charge was that a prisoner who had assaulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
and wounded a warder with a pair of scissors,
had not only been flogged, but the governor
had specially sentenced him to be deprived henceforward
of all instruction, religious or moral.</p>

<p>The fourth charge referred to a prisoner, Bourne,
whom it was alleged the doctor had neglected, refusing
to see him, although he was actually in a dying
state. At length the officer of his ward sent
specially to the doctor, who came and had Bourne
removed to the infirmary, where he died two days
afterward. “It was the governors plain duty to
have prevented such a catastrophe,” said Baker.</p>

<p>Fifth: a prisoner, Harris Nash, died of dysentery
after three months of the ordinary discipline. “The
body was what may be termed a perfect skeleton.”</p>

<p>Sixth: another prisoner, a boy, Richmond, from
Edinburgh, died after four months, having been
confined in a dungeon on one pound of bread
and two pints of water per diem, for an unlimited
number of days. At night he lay upon the
boards and had only a rug and blanket to cover
him.</p>

<p>Seventh: several prisoners who had been present
at the infliction of corporal punishment had immediately
after hanged themselves, shocked by the
sight they had seen.</p>

<p>Eighth: many instances were quoted of the governor’s
harshness and partiality: fines inflicted unequally,
old officers punished through his misrepresentation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
others deprived of their situations as inefficient,
though for years they had been considered
efficient; while several had resigned sooner than
submit to such tyranny.</p>

<p>Ninth: Edward Baker further asserted that the
reply furnished to the House to his first petition was
garbled and untrue. It had been prepared secretly
in the prison; it was altogether false; facts had
been suppressed or distorted; and that besides, the
“cats” used were not those sanctioned by law.</p>

<p>Tenth: that the governor had exceeded his powers
of punishment, and that in some cases prisoners
had undergone as many as eighteen days’ bread
and water in one month.</p>

<p>Finally, to quote the words of the petition, Baker
urged that&mdash;“During the last three years the cruel
conduct of the governor is known to have induced
twenty prisoners to attempt suicide, and that four
have actually succeeded in destroying themselves,
and that others are constantly threatening self-destruction;
forming a melancholy contrast with
the system pursued during the twenty-three preceding
years at the Millbank Penitentiary, that system
being free from any such stain during that
period:</p>

<p>“That the severity of punishments for alleged
offences has led to the removal of many prisoners
in a dying state to the invalid hulk at Woolwich,
where every seventh man has since died, although
when they came into the prison they were in good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
health. This cruel removal takes place to prevent
the necessity for coroner’s inquests within the walls,
and exposure of the discipline of the prison.”</p>

<p>The petitioner therefore prays for an immediate
inquiry into the manner in which Millbank is conducted,
the deaths that have occurred, the cruelties
that are practised, the dying prisoners that have
been removed; also into the numerous reports and
irregular hours and conduct of the governor, and
how far the inspectors have done their duty by allowing
such irregularities to pass unnoticed; “such
facts being notorious to all the prison.”</p>

<p>In consequence of this petition an inquiry was
instituted by the House of Commons; and the Earl
of Chichester, Lord Seymour, and Mr. Bickham
Escott were appointed commissioners.</p>

<p>A very searching and patient investigation followed,
the full report of which fills an enormous
Blue-Book of hundreds of pages. It would be
tedious to the reader if I were to go through the
evidence, in anything like detail, of the many witnesses
examined; the commissioners may be trusted
to have done this conscientiously, and their summing
up in deciding on the allegations against Captain
Grove may be quoted here. The evident animus
of the subordinates against their governor is
very clearly shown in every page: nothing he did
was right, and the complaints when not actually
false, as in the case of prisoner Chinnery, were
childish and almost beneath consideration. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
officer declared that Captain Groves did not like the
old prison officers; that he had said openly “he
would get them all out.” They could never please
him; they got no credit however much they might
exert themselves. Another told the governor he
was breaking his (the officer’s) spirit and his heart.
“He (Captain Groves), after making his rounds,
would send for supervisors and warders in a body
and reprimand them in his office. Once when an
officer expostulated with him, Captain Groves struck
him to the ground with his stick, and swore he’d
have none of his d&mdash;&mdash;d Penitentiary tricks.” Another
officer, who had been sent to Pentonville and
came back without an important document, complained
that he had been sent again all the way
to the Caledonian Road to fetch it. Mr. Gray (the
victim) considered this was a great hardship, although
he admitted that he was none the worse for
his walk. All the officers were positive they had
much more to do now than ever before. Mr. Gray,
above-mentioned, complained also that he had been
deprived of his lawful leave; yet he admitted that
when all the paint work of the prison was filthily
dirty and had to be scrubbed, it was badly done;
and that the governor had only insisted on officers
remaining on duty till the whole was properly
cleaned.</p>

<p>It was indeed quite evident from cross-examination
and from the evidence of Captain Groves, that
the bulk of his officers were slovenly, slack in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
execution of their duties, and contentious. Captain
Groves, on the other hand, was doing his best to
improve the tone of discipline. No doubt he was
stern and peremptory in his dealings. We can quite
understand that his reprimands were not couched in
milk-and-water language; that he more than once
said, “By this, or that,” and swore he would not
suffer such doings to pass unpunished, and that
those who opposed him should forthwith be dismissed.
But it is also clear that he was not well
served. Those who held under him important posts
were not always reliable and fitted for the charge.
On one occasion, for instance, an officer was so
negligent of the prisoners in his charge, that the
governor, as he came by, was able to remove one
unobserved. This prisoner he took back to his cell,
and then returned to the spot to ask the officer how
many he had in charge.</p>

<p>“So many.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure? Count them.”</p>

<p>“No; I am one short!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the governor, and added something
more in rather stronger language. Again, in the
case of two barefaced escapes the governor expressed
himself as follows:</p>

<p>“Prisoner Howard escaped under the very nose
of No. 2 sentry. The night was clear and fine, and
the governor cannot acquit the sentry of No. 2 beat
of great negligence. It is quite impossible, on such
a night as the night of last Friday, for any individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
to have performed such work in the garden as
raising planks, etc., against the boundary wall without
detection had common care been taken.”</p>

<p>“In regard to the escape of Timothy Tobin, the
operations he had recourse to, to break through the
cell, made great noise, and attracted the attention
of several of the night guard; and the governor is
concerned to find that the principal warder in
charge of the prison as orderly officer made no
effort to detect the cause of the constant knocking
in Pentagon five, but contented himself with the
reports of inferior officers without rising from his
bed or anticipating his intended time of going his
rounds. The qualifications which entitle an officer
to promotion in this and every other establishment,
are intelligence, activity, and a sense of individual
responsibility; and no person is fit for the situation
of supervisor or principal warder who is not prepared
to exercise them on all occasions.”</p>

<p>This was a reference to Mr. Gray; and it was he
who, with others equally negligent, were so sensitive,
that they felt aggrieved at Captain Groves’
seemingly merited reprimands. But in actual investigation
all charges of this kind melted into thin
air as soon as the commissioners looked into them.
The charges of tyranny were not substantiated, because
they were far-fetched and exaggerated. Such
stories must have been difficult to find when one
of the charges trumped up against the governor
was that he had kept the chaplain’s clerk one day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
without his dinner. We should even assert that the
whole inquiry was another monument of misdirected
zeal, were it not that the original petition opened
up serious topics which demanded attention. The
mere details of administrative bickering might have
been better settled by officials within the department
than by parliamentary interference; but when it is
alleged in an indictment that unfortunate prisoners,
without a friend in the world, are done to death by
ill-treatment, it is clearly necessary that the said
charges should be sifted without delay. In this way
the inquiry was distinctly useful, and I shall now
give the decision at which the commissioners arrived.</p>

<p>“These petitions seriously impugned the character
and conduct of the governor of Millbank
Prison; and consequently imputed to the inspectors,
under whose superintendence the government of
this prison is placed, a culpable neglect of their duty
in having permitted such maladministration to continue.</p>

<p>“First: the allegation respecting the treatment
of Chinnery is the only charge on which the petitioner
could prove anything from his own knowledge;
and, since it occurred after he had sent in his
resignation, could not be one of the instances of
cruelty in consequence of which he resigned. The
fault or innocence of the governor on this occasion
depends entirely upon the validity of reasons alleged
by him for concluding that the prisoner was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
only feigning a fit. There being no other witness
but himself and Baker, we cannot pronounce a decided
opinion upon so very doubtful a question.
Reviewing, however, all the circumstances which
were brought under our notice in connection with
this case, we think the governor should, before
awarding the punishment, have made a closer investigation
into all the facts, and have consulted the
medical officer for the purpose of testing the probable
accuracy of his impressions. In this case, therefore,
we are of opinion that the punishment, whether
merited or not merited by the prisoner, was injudiciously
inflicted by the governor.</p>

<p>“Second: The commissioners think the governor
rather overstrained his powers in punishing the
boys for reading their Bibles in chapel.</p>

<p>“Third: The prisoner Bunyan was sentenced
and punished by flogging, as described, for an aggravated
and malicious assault. The second allegation,
that he was ordered to receive ‘no instruction,
either religious or moral’ is untrue. He was
visited by the chaplain, and had the usual access to
religious books.</p>

<p>“Fourth: No evidence to support charge against
the governor in case of H. Bourne; but the latter
was certainly not well treated by the resident medical
officer.</p>

<p>“Fifth: Harris Nash died of a severe attack of
dysentery. He was an ill-conditioned, mutinous
prisoner, who frequently attacked his officers; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
though he was often punished, his death was attributable
to the dysentery and nothing else.</p>

<p>“Sixth: No responsibility rests with the governor
as to Richmond’s death. No symptom of disease
on him when first he arrived at Millbank, and
he was never punished when the disease showed
itself.</p>

<p>“Seventh: There does not appear to be the
slightest foundation for the suggestion insinuated
in this charge; neither of the three prisoners named
having witnessed any punishments calculated to
produce a bad effect on their minds.</p>

<p>“Eighth: The charges of partiality were distinctly
disproved; as were also the allegations contained
under Ninth and Tenth, which were found to
be quite ‘unfounded, in fact.’</p>

<p>“Upon the general charge of irregularity, and
especially upon a charge of intoxication preferred
by some of the witnesses, after a minute consideration
of all the circumstances detailed in the evidence,
we feel bound to acquit the governor, and to
express our strong disapprobation of the manner in
which the charge was attempted to be proved.</p>

<p>“Having thoroughly sifted the complaint against
the governor, and made some allowance for exaggeration
on the part of witnesses, whose accusations
were seldom warranted by the facts which they
attempted to prove, we have no hesitation in pronouncing
our opinion that he (Captain Groves) has
endeavoured to perform his duties with zeal and intelligence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
and has done nothing to discredit the
very high testimonials which he possesses from the
officers in the army under whom he formerly served.
His treatment of the prisoners, except in the two
cases above mentioned, appears to have been judicious
and considerate. Cases were indeed brought
under our notice in which the prisoners complained
of excessive severity; but the responsibility for
these cases rests upon the subordinate officers, as it
does not appear that the governor was made acquainted
with these complaints. The substitution
of the punishment of reduced diet in lieu of a dark
cell appears to have been made by the governor
from motives of leniency and with a view to preserving
the health of prisoners.</p>

<p>“The only faults with which he appears justly
chargeable are:&mdash;</p>

<p>“First: A too hasty method of dealing with his
officers when reported to him by others, or detected
by himself in some neglect of duty; not always
giving them a sufficient opportunity for explanation
or defence.</p>

<p>“Second: The occasional use of improper or
offensive expressions, of which we should express
our condemnation more strongly were it not that
the instances adduced by all the witnesses amounted
only to three.</p>

<p>“Third: An insufficient attention to the rules
of the prison; it appearing from his own evidence
that he was entirely ignorant of the legal force of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the old penitentiary rules, and that in two important
instances the rules actually stuck up in the prison
were not strictly attended to by him.</p>

<p>“The want of a complete code of rules suited to
the present government of the prison has apparently
given rise to many of the charges and to much of
the ill-feeling which have come under our observation
during this inquiry.</p>

<p>“No doubt there existed a very extended feeling
of discontent among the officers. It is probable
that this may partly have originated in the changes
which took place in the organization of the present
establishment, by which the duties of the prison
were necessarily rendered more irksome and
severe.</p>

<p>“The old prison possessed more of a reformatory
character: the prisoners were confined there for
much longer periods, were under the influence of
stronger motives to good conduct, and by habits
longer exercised became more accustomed to the
regular routine of prison life. In the prison, as now
constituted, few of the adult convicts remain for
more than two, or at most, three months; and of
those who remain for a longer period, the greater
part are criminals of the worst description, who are
awaiting embarkation for their final destination,
Norfolk Island.</p>

<p>“The effective government of these convicts can
only be carried on by a very strict and vigilant attention
on the part of the officers. We must add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
that these important changes had to be commenced
and carried out by a new governor with an old set
of officers, and, in our opinion, with an inadequate
addition of strength. It was but natural that the
old officers, receiving little or no increase of pay,
while their duties were generally augmented, should
have felt some dissatisfaction, and that a portion
of it should have vented itself in personal feelings
towards the governor, who appears to be both a
zealous and energetic officer, giving his orders in a
peremptory manner as a man accustomed to military
life, and expecting them to be obeyed with
soldierlike precision. We regret, however, to observe
that, whilst these officers omitted to make a
single complaint or suggestion of grievance to their
legitimate superiors, they formed a kind of combination
amongst themselves for the discussion of
their supposed wrongs and for collecting matter for
complaint against the governor.”</p>

<p>On the whole, then, Captain Groves came triumphantly
out of the inquiry into his conduct. Beyond
doubt his task was a difficult one. He had within
the walls of his prison a large body of criminals
who were not to be managed easily. Their offences
were more deliberate, and their violence more systematic
than anything which I have described in the
Penitentiary days. When they assaulted officers,
which they did frequently, from Captain Groves
himself downwards, it was with the intention of
murdering them; and when they wished to escape,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
as often as not they managed to get away. They
stabbed their officers with shoemakers’ knives, or
dug scissors into their arms; while one, when
searched, was found with a heavy cell stone slung
to a cord, supplying thus a murderous weapon, of
which he coolly promised to make use against the
first who approached. Another ruffian, named
Long, a powerful, athletic man, dashed at his officer’s
throat and demanded the instant surrender
of his keys. Edward King, another, meeting the
governor on his rounds, assailed him with abuse,
then struck him on the mouth; whereupon Captain
Groves promptly knocked him down.</p>

<p>Of all the annoyances, none equalled those that
came from the “juvenile ward,” as it was termed.
In this Captain Groves had raised a sort of Frankenstein
to irritate and annoy him, which he found
difficult to control. Early in his reign he had felt
the necessity for some special treatment of boy
prisoners. There were nearly two hundred of
these; and though styled boys, they were many
of them youths of ages varying from seventeen to
twenty years. After much anxious consideration
he constructed from his own plans a large general
ward to accommodate the whole number. This
building long existed, although it was afterwards
converted into a Roman Catholic chapel. It was
built of brick, only one story high, with a light
roof supported by slender iron rods. Around the
wall were bays, holding each three hammocks by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
night, but in which these juveniles worked during
the day. And they could work well if they pleased.
For general intelligence and astuteness these boys
were not to be matched in all the world. They
were the <i>élite</i> of the London <i>gamins</i>, the most noted
rogues, the cleverest thieves, and the most unmitigated
young vagabonds of the whole metropolis.
It was a similar gathering, but on a larger scale, to
that with which we are familiar in the pages of
“Oliver Twist.” Properly directed, they had talent
enough for anything. They were soon taught to
be expert tradesmen; could stitch with the best
tailors, and turn out an “upper” or a “half sole”
without a flaw. It was part of Captain Groves’
scheme to drill them; and these active lads soon
constituted an uncommonly smart battalion.</p>

<p>So far we see only the bright side of the picture;
the reverse is not so exhilarating. The mere fact
of bringing together in this way a mass of juvenile
rascality, without adequate means of restraint, was
to open the door to mutinous combinations and defiant
conduct. Over and above the buoyancy of
spirits natural to youth, which tempts every schoolboy
to mischief, there was present among the inmates
of this juvenile ward an amount of innate
depravity, due to early training and general recklessness
of life, which soon led them to the most
violent excesses. Within a week or two of the
opening of the ward under the brightest auspices,
the governor recorded that already they exhibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
strong tendencies to run riot. They used threatening
language to their officers, were continually at
loggerheads with each other, and their quarrels
soon ended in blows. Presently one made a violent
attack on his warder, and kicked his shins; but for
this he was incontinently flogged, and for a time the
lightheartedness of the ward was checked. But
only for a time; within a week the bickering recommenced,
and there were half a dozen fights in
less than half a dozen days. Appeal was now made
to the birch-rod, also for a time effectual. But the
temptation to misconduct in marching to and fro
from drill, exercise, or chapel was too strong for
these young ragamuffins, and their next feat was
to put out the gas as they went, then lark along the
passages. The governor prayed for more power to
punish them. “By their refractory and insolent
conduct,” he says, “they wear out the patience of
every officer set over them, and turn him into an
object of ridicule and contempt.”</p>

<p>It occurred to them now that they could cause
some considerable inconvenience by breaking out at
night; so night after night, when the watch was
set and the prison was quiet, they burst out into
yells and general uproar, till the night guards were
compelled to ring the alarm bells to call assistance.
This continued to such an extent that Captain
Groves feared it would be impossible to persuade
officers to remain in the general ward after dark.
Of course they were all experienced thieves. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
one occasion an officer on duty had his pocket picked
of a snuff-box. “I know where it is,” volunteered
a boy; but after a long search it could not be found
in the place he indicated: then they searched the
boy himself, and found the box secreted on his
person. Another lad, with infinite cunning, nearly
succeeded in effecting his escape. One night after
midnight he left his bed, and crawling under the
other hammocks, got to a wide stone which covered
the entrance to the ventilating flues. This stone he
removed, and then descended into the flue, meaning
to follow it till he reached the airing-yard; thence
he meant to climb to the roof and descend again.
In view of this he carried with him a long cord,
made of sundry skeins of thread, which from time
to time he had stolen and secreted. As it happened,
a warder going his rounds set his foot on the mat
which the boy had placed over the hole into the flue,
tripped, and nearly tumbled in; then the prisoner,
who was in the flue, fearing he was discovered,
came out. But for this accident he might have got
clean away. After this the uproarious behaviour
of the boys waxed worse. The governor began to
have serious apprehensions that discipline would
greatly suffer. Stronger measures of repression
were tried, but without effect. They continued to
fight, to yell in concert after dark, and refused to
work, assaulting and maltreating their officers by
throwing brooms at their heads and kicking their
shins. Throughout, too, their conduct in chapel was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
most disgraceful, and it became a serious question
“whether they ought not to be kept away altogether
from divine service, as their example would certainly
attract followers among the general body of
the prisoners.”</p>

<p>At length it came to pass that the ward must be
broken up, and the boys distributed among the various
pentagons. It was felt to be dangerous to keep
so many elements of discord concentrated together
in one room. This was accordingly done; but by
and by, for reasons that are not given&mdash;probably
on account of want of space in the crowded condition
of the prison&mdash;the general ward was again
occupied with these precocious juveniles. Yet, as
I find it recorded, within a few days a scene took
place in the room at a late hour of the night, which
called for immediate decisive action.</p>

<p>About eleven o’clock the governor was sent for.
The ward was described to be in a state of mutiny.
On his arrival the prisoners appeared much excited,
but comparatively quiet. At his order they assembled
quietly enough and fell in by word of command.
He then asked what it all meant, and heard
that for a half hour there had been periodic shoutings,
and this chiefly from one particular boy. As
it rose at last to something serious, the alarm bell
was rung, and on the arrival of the reserve guard
the ringleader was pointed out, by name Sullivan,
who had shouted the loudest. Ordered first to get
out of his hammock, he obstinately refused to move,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
and when at last dislodged by force, he broke away
from the officers, jumped on to the hammock rails,
and thence to the iron girders of the roof. An
officer promptly followed him, and “a scene ensued
which it is impossible to describe.” He was at
length captured, and upon the whole incident the
governor remarks as follows: “These circumstances
afford matter for grave consideration.
Hitherto, owing to strict discipline and energy on
the part of the officers, the system of the juvenile
ward has been successful, with occasional exceptions
in regard to misbehaviour on the part of a few
turbulent characters. Of late, generally speaking,
their conduct has been insubordinate and disorderly,
and the fact is that the officers in charge of them
are under serious apprehensions for their own personal
safety. Besides, as I have before noticed,
owing to the paucity of their number, their rest is
broken night after night by being obliged to rise
from their beds to quell disturbances; whilst the
night guards, who ought to be taking their rest
in the day time, are obliged to attend at the prison
for the purpose of substantiating their reports of
the previous night.</p>

<p>“It is quite evident that there are so many prisoners
(180) assembled an outbreak would be difficult
to quell; and in my opinion the situation is a
serious one, calling for immediate consideration.
Many of them are athletic, and fierce in point of
temper likewise.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>The governor decided to place patrols in the juvenile
ward taken from the garden, although he was
loath to denude the garden of guards, seeing that
the prison was full to overflowing of convicts.</p>

<p>I have dealt in the last few pages with the misconduct
of the boys as it showed itself in a comparatively
short period of time.</p>

<p>The contumacy of these lads continued for more
than a year: again and again they broke out, insulted,
bearded, browbeat their officers till the latter
stood almost in awe of their charges; night after
night the pentagon was made hideous with their
outcries and uproar. The governor was pressed to
abolish the ward altogether; but the project was
a pet one, and he hesitated to abandon it. He never
quite got the better of the boys; but in the end
firmness and a resolute exhibition of authority had
its effect, and the ward, if not entirely quelled, was
at least brought to something like subordination and
order.</p>

<p>It is of course clear to the reader that the convicts
who were now and hereafter contained within the
Millbank walls comprised the worst of the criminal
class. There is this difference between the calendars
at Newgate and at Millbank, that at the former
place the worst criminals passed without delay to
the gallows, while at the large depot prison they
remained to continually vex their keepers.</p>

<p>The life of Millbank was prolonged until the end
of the nineteenth century, by which time the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
and palatial buildings at Wormwood Scrubs, on
the western outskirts of London, had been completed.
A word is appropriate here as to this imposing
edifice which was begun in a very small way
by the writer, in the winter of 1874. The plan
pursued was identical with that of Elam Lynds
when he built Sing Sing on the banks of the Hudson.
Lynds must have been a fine self-reliant character,
of such unwavering courage that it gave him
personal ascendency over the dangerous elements
in his charge. When they told him that a certain
convict openly threatened to murder him, he sent
for the man, who was a barber, and made him shave
him. “I knew you had said you would kill me,”
he remarked quietly after the shaving was over.
“I despised you too much to believe you would do
it. Here alone, unarmed, I am stronger than you,
and the whole of your companions.”</p>

<p>The work at Wormwood Scrubs as at Sing Sing
was almost entirely done by the convicts themselves
under the supervision of the warders and directing
staff.</p>

<p>An indispensable preliminary was the provision
of a boundary fence enclosing an area of three acres
of common land. This fence was of simple planking
ten feet in height. Inside this space the shell
of a slight temporary prison had also been erected,
a two-storied building, of wood on an iron framework
filled in with brick “nogging” (a single brick
thick), the cells lined and separated with sheet iron.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Nine of these cells were completed with locked
doors and barred windows when they were at once
occupied by nine “special class” prisoners, men
who were in the last year of a lengthy sentence and
little likely to run away and forfeit privileges already
earned. From this germ or nucleus the
whole establishment grew. The first comers laboured
on the still unfinished cells and as they were
gotten ready fresh arrivals were imported to fill
them. In a short time the whole block of a hundred
cells was completed, and with the numbers which
could now be lodged there was strength sufficient
for very extended operations: the erection of a
second block for another hundred convicts; and
the preparation of clay for brickmaking, and the
digging for the foundations of the main prison.
Such rapid progress was made that within six
months I had established the brick mills and had
turned out a large number of “London stock,”&mdash;the
sound, hard, light yellow bricks, the chief building
material of our modern metropolis. The place
was largely self-contained and self-supporting; we
did everything as far as possible for ourselves; we
had our own carpenters and smiths; we dressed
stone for the window sills and cast the iron bars
and framework for staircases. Ere long the prison
population reached a daily average of from five
to six hundred, and in less than five years we had
built four large blocks containing 350 cells apiece,
a spacious chapel, a boundary wall and beyond it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
numerous residences for the governor and staff.
Throughout this period, Millbank was the parent
prison, Wormwood Scrubs only an offshoot drawing
support, supplies, cash, all necessaries from the
older establishment.</p>

<p>Millbank continued to be a centre of great criminal
interest to the very end. As has been shown,
it became the depot and starting-point for all convicts
sentenced to penal exile, and when a peremptory
stop was put to transportation, it worked in
with the substituted system of Public Works prisons.
For fifty years it was a receptacle for male
and female convicts undergoing the first period of
separate confinement, the preliminary to associated
work with greater freedom. Notorieties of all
kinds passed through it; and the names of almost
all the celebrated prisoners of the time were to be
found upon its registers. There were murderers
who had scraped through and just escaped the death
penalty, such as Dixblanc, the French cook who
murdered her mistress in Park Lane. Constance
Kent, who confessed to the mysterious crime of killing
her infant brother, spent many years at Millbank;
the cruel and infamous Stantons, who starved
poor Alice&mdash;&mdash; at Penge, began their retribution
there; Madame Rachel, the would-be benefactor to
her sex which she desired to make beautiful for ever,
tried her blandishments on more than one Millbank
matron. It was my fate to welcome the Tichborne
claimant to durance vile, to watch him wasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
from excessive obesity to a decent and respectable
size, lachrymose and repentant, but secretive and
defiant to the last. The moving spirits in the De
Goncourt affair, Kurr and Benson, made Millbank
their medium of communication with the dishonest
detective officers who for a time shook public confidence
in the London police force.</p>

<p>Millbank served for other prison purposes. In
its latest phases, part of its accommodation was
leased to military authorities and it was long the
home of court-martial prisoners. When the State
finally acquired all prisons of every category in the
country, it was used for the retention of venial
offenders sent by petty sessions and police courts.</p>

<p>The end came in 1891, when Millbank was
finally closed and the site surrendered by the prison
authorities to the government Office of Works.</p>

<p>Here the London County Council have built
dwellings for the poor; a handsome military hospital
for the Guards and London District has been
erected by the War Office; and the trustees of the
Tait bequest have put up a fine gallery to house the
valuable pictures with which that munificent patron
has endowed London. Thus buildings of a new
and very different character have now replaced the
old Penitentiary.</p>

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
